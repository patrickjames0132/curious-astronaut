Description:
Fixtures for the offline citations-corpus tests: a tiny synthetic release.

No network and no real Datasets pull — a handful of ``papers``/``citations``
records are written as gzipped JSONL shards, ingested to a temp corpus dir, and
activated, exactly as the real ``astronaut corpus download`` + ``ingest`` would. The
seed is "Attention Is All You Need" (arXiv ``1706.03762``, corpus id 1); its
citers are BERT (80k cites), GPT-3 (50k), and one paper published within the
recent window — enough to assert citation-sorted landmarks and the latest split.

#: than one export batch and the batches overlap: 2026-07-07 advertises 240 shards
#: stamped `…_00151_3g69z_…` and 150 stamped `…_00016_bxc9g_…`, together ~5.1B rows
#: for ~2.7B distinct edges. Note BERT's copy here **disagrees** on
#: `isinfluential`, and that the duplicate spans a different *shard* — so a
#: per-shard dedupe at ingest could never catch it. Keeping this in the fixture
#: means the ordinary landmark assertions fail if the query stops deduping.
