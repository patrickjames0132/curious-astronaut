Description:
The shared ``show_source_figure`` core (agents/library_figures.py).

Focused on what the **trace chip** ends up saying, since that's what the user
reads when an attach fails: which source was reached into, and what was
actually asked for. The resolver and the store are faked — this is about the
events the helper emits, not about mining.
