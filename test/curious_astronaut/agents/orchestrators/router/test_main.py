Description:
The router: the no-model fast path claims only the phrasings that name a
lecture outright *and point at nothing in particular*, the model's decision
passes through untouched, every failure answers the question instead, and
the name resolver turns a message into graph ids without ever raising.

The most valuable assertions here are the *negative* ones. The fast path's
whole justification is that it is narrower than it could be — "summarize
this" and "walk me through X" are ambiguous and belong to the model, and
since v7.23.0 so is any lecture request that says *which* papers ("…on the
references"), because the scope is the half a regex cannot read — and
nothing about the code says so out loud. Widening the pattern is a one-line
change a later reader would find tempting, so the phrasings it must NOT
claim are pinned by name.
