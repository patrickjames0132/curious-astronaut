Description:
Lecture scoping: which nodes a lecture narrates, and in what order. Since
v7.17.0 the answer is "the ones the caller sent" — the reader's own on-screen
scope, after their filters and hand-picked selection — put in chronological
order, and nothing added to it.

This file used to pin the opposite contract: four mode buttons, each scoped
to exactly one graph relation *to the seed*, rebuilt here from the edge list
(v7.7.0). Those tests are gone with the modes. The one that mattered most
survives inverted, at the bottom: the paper a mode used to exclude is now
included, because the reader put it on screen.

This scoping lived in the orchestrator until v7.0.0, when that router was
deleted and the routes began calling agents directly — it is the lecturer's
own business, so it (and its tests) moved here.
