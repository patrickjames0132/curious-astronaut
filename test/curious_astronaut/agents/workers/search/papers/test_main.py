Description:
The paper scout's three lookup channels and the numbering that joins them: a
lexical `search`, a `match_title` that resolves one named paper, a semantic
`more_like` that indexes into what the others found, and the budget all three
spend from — plus the caller filters that bind every one of them.

The tools are exercised as plain functions with a stub context — they touch
nothing but `ctx.deps`, and going through a scripted agent would test
PydanticAI's tool dispatch rather than the scout's own logic (the researcher's
suite already covers the seam above).
