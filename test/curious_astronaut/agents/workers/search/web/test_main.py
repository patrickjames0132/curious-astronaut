Description:
The web scout's degradation path: what happens when the configured vendor has
no provider-side web search at all (a local Ollama model, since v7.13.0).

Both the vendor check and the model are read per run (``factory``), so these
patch the factory rather than a module constant.

The behaviour under test is deliberately a *refusal to call the model*. An
agent instructed to search, holding no search tool, does not fail cleanly — it
invents sources — so "don't ask it" is the only honest answer, and these tests
pin that rather than the wording of the message.

``scout`` is a coroutine and this suite carries no async plugin, so each test
drives it with ``asyncio.run``. That is deliberate over adding pytest-asyncio
for two tests: nothing here needs the app's shared loop (see ``streams.py``),
only a coroutine run to completion.
