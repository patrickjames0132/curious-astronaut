Description:
Shared fixtures for the Curious Astronaut test suite.

The suite is **fully offline** — no live arXiv / Semantic Scholar / Anthropic
calls, and no touching the real ``data/`` directory. The autouse ``_isolate``
fixture enforces that baseline for every test, and PydanticAI's
``ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS`` kill switch (flipped off below, process-wide) makes
any un-overridden agent run raise before it can touch the network — agent
tests swap in ``TestModel`` / ``FunctionModel`` via ``agent.override(...)``.
``stub_embeddings`` swaps the sentence-transformers model for a cheap
deterministic hash embedder so the sources pipeline can be tested without
loading torch.

    The three DB paths derive from ``data_dir``, so one override relocates
    them all. Zeroing the ``min_interval`` throttles keeps tests from sleeping.

    The offline S2 citations corpus is forced **off** (``s2_corpus`` nulled). A
    real corpus in config.json would otherwise make citation tests query the
    machine's live one — in the two-root era this isolation once leaked when
    only one root was nulled and the corpus tests wrote their synthetic
    release into the real (mid-ingest) Parquet root. A corpus test opts back
    in by pointing the root at its own temp dir (see that package's conftest).

    Semantic search is forced **off** (``semantic_enabled``) for the same
    reason, and it is not theoretical: any test that reaches
    ``sources.retrieval.search`` — the researcher's ``search_sources`` tool,
    for one — would otherwise call the *real* embedder, download a
    sentence-transformers model, and run it. That silently made the suite
    non-offline on any machine with torch installed, and on Windows CI's CUDA
    build with no GPU it crashed the interpreter outright (access violation in
    ``torch/cuda/graphs.py``). Nothing here needs a real model: a test that
    wants embeddings takes ``stub_embeddings``, which patches
    ``available``/``embed_texts``/``embed_query`` directly and so is unaffected
    by this switch.
