Description:
Seed discovery (services/search): the cache-first local search, over real
SQLite on the per-test temp DB, plus field-filter validation.

Live search left this module in v7.6.0 (the paper scout owns it now), so what
remains is the half the scout calls *into* rather than duplicates — see
``test/curious_astronaut/agents/workers/search/papers/test_main.py`` for the search itself.
