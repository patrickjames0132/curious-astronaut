Description:
Hybrid retrieval (sources/retrieval.py): FTS5 lexical + vector KNN fused via RRF.

Offline — no embedding model, no network. The pure-function tests cover the FTS5
query sanitizer and the RRF fusion; the integration tests drive the real
``sources.search`` over a temp library with the vector side stubbed off, so they
exercise the lexical + fusion path end-to-end (triggers keep FTS5 in sync).
