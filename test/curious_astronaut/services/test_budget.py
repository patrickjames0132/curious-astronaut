Description:
The adaptive landmark-budget serving paths (services/graph/budget.py).

The two ways to size a seed's landmark band, both pinned here (see
``docs/landmark-vocabulary.md`` for the vocabulary). Both are pure rules over a
ranked citer-year list, with no artifact involved:

* ``number_of_ranked_citers_before_a_single_year_overflows`` — the STOP rule, the
  serving rule for every whole-history pool via ``computed_cite_limit``.
* ``select_up_to_cap_per_year`` / ``select_landmarks`` — the SKIP rule, and the
  truncated-live-pool trim built on it.
