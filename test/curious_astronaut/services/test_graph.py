Description:
Neighborhood-graph assembly (services/graph/build.py): the typed Graph model —
single-provider traversals, within-provider dedupe, edge directions, counts, the
provider-keyed snapshot cache, and the two provider paths (S2 / OpenAlex).

Provider traversals are monkeypatched with canned node dicts; the cache is real
SQLite on the per-test temp DB (see conftest ``_isolate``). A graph is built from
ONE provider end-to-end — there is no cross-source hybrid — so each provider gets
its own fixture.
