Description:
The per-request build shape: which rules each mode injects, and its cache key.

The behavioral claims worth pinning are that **adaptive mode is byte-identical
to the pre-shape app** (same rules, same cache key — so existing snapshots still
hit) and that **non-adaptive mode declines every adaptive rule**, which is how it
reaches the traversals' flat payload-guard fallback without any traversal
learning about shapes.
