## Vision

**Curious Astronaut** turns a research paper into something explorable and puts
an AI teacher beside it. Drop in a paper (say *Attention Is All You Need*) and it
renders a **Connected-Papers-style interactive graph** of how it links to the
literature — the papers it built on, the papers it spawned, and its nearest
neighbors by meaning. Then hit **"Teach me how we got here"** and Claude narrates
the *history and intuition* of the field — the problem each seminal paper solved,
why it mattered, how each idea made the next possible — **while the graph lights
up node-by-node in sync with the story.** And like any good teacher, it takes
questions: **interrupt and ask a follow-up**, and it answers grounded in the
papers on screen, highlighting the nodes it draws from. It's the storytelling
magic of NotebookLM (narrative and a teacher's voice), self-hosted and
model-driven, married to an interactive citation graph NotebookLM never had.

### Why it exists — and what that means for this list

**Curious Astronaut is not a business, and is not trying to become one** (Patrick,
2026-08-16). It is three things: a tool its author actually uses, a real
research vehicle (the citation-coverage and landmark-selection work in
[docs/citation-coverage.md](docs/citation-coverage.md) and
[docs/landmark-vocabulary.md](docs/landmark-vocabulary.md)), and an
open-source attempt to put research and self-teaching in reach of **anyone**
who wants to learn something.

That inverts the usual risk model, and the inversion is the reason this
section exists. A competitor with more reach shipping something similar is
the mission *succeeding*, not the project dying — so **"is this feature
unique?" is not a question worth asking here.** The threats that are real are
**cost, installability, and discoverability**: a person who cannot afford an
API key, cannot get past the setup script, or never finds the project is a
person the app failed. Weight the Backlog accordingly — see **Reach & access**,
deliberately placed first.

*(A competitive sweep on 2026-08-16 confirmed the landscape this assumes:
Connected Papers still ships no LLM layer at all; Litmaps acquired
ResearchRabbit in 2025 and both remain visualizers; Ai2's Asta shipped
agentic search with neither a citation-graph UI nor user-document grounding;
NotebookLM maps your uploaded sources, never the literature's citation
structure. The graph-as-retrieval-scope binding and the your-library +
live-graph mix were not found elsewhere. Nothing here depends on that staying
true.)*

We **leave the storage to the ecosystem** (Semantic Scholar / OpenAlex / arXiv)
and connect dynamically — no mandatory local corpus, just a thin cache of the AI
artifacts we generate. (One deliberate exception since v5.4.0: an **optional**
offline copy of S2's bulk citation data, for the all-history landmark rankings
the live API can't serve.)

## The layered feature stack

Presented in build order. `[core]` = part of the v1.0 experience; `[flag]` =
optional, behind a key.

1. **Citation graph** `[core]` — the structural map. Nodes = papers; edges =
   references / citations / similarity. Built on **Semantic Scholar** (the same
   data backbone Connected Papers uses). Color by year, size by citation count,
   edge weight by similarity. Click to expand a node's neighborhood.

2. **AI teacher — "how we got here"** `[core]` — Claude generates a chronological
   lecture over a paper's lineage: ordered beats, each tied to a node, explaining
   intuition and significance. The **graph is the synchronized visual** — nodes
   highlight as the narrative advances. Secondary modes: *explain this paper's
   intuition*, *bridge these two topics*.

3. **Ask the teacher — Q&A** `[core]` — interrupt the lecture and ask follow-ups
   ("why did attention replace RNNs?", "how does this node differ from that
   one?"). Claude answers **grounded in the papers currently on the graph** — the
   visible neighborhood is the retrieval scope, so no separate vector store is
   needed — and **highlights the nodes it cites**, keeping every answer anchored
   to the map. Conversational, so you can go back and forth; questions that reach
   past the neighborhood expand the graph or pull that paper from S2 on demand.

4. **Knowledge Graph — a short course on a paper's prerequisites** `[core]`
   — a second tool beside the Paper Graph, on the same seed paper. The paper
   sits at the centre of a graph you grow one item at a time into **the ideas
   you need to know to understand it**. Each concept can be broken down
   further — DQN → Q-learning → Bellman equations → … → eigenvectors, as deep
   as you care to go — and a concept two items need is one node. Check off
   what you already know and that part of the course is skipped. The
   unchecked nodes, ordered prerequisites-first, are **the course**, with a
   lesson at each stop that cites the paper's real references and, later,
   interactive visuals built on the fly. *(Replaced the plain concept mindmap, 2026-10-06 — a mindmap
   over your own sources is NotebookLM's feature; this one answers a
   different question: not "what does the paper say" but "what do I need
   first".)*

5. **Slides from the lecture** `[core]` — a deck generated **by the agent crew
   we already run**, from the lecture beats it already writes, embedding the
   **papers' own figures** we already mine out of the open-access PDFs. No
   third-party media API and no subscription: three things that exist,
   composed. *(Replaced the AutoContent API plan, 2026-08-16 — see below.)*

6. **Bridge two topics** `[core]` — the surviving half of the old concept
   mindmap: cross-linking two fields with no citation edge between them (e.g.
   astrophysics ↔ reinforcement learning). Pure reasoning, rendered in the
   same graph library.

**Retired 2026-08-16 — ~~audio lecture~~ (Podcastfy + Edge TTS / ElevenLabs)
and ~~polished media~~ (AutoContent API decks, infographics, video).**
NotebookLM now ships audio overviews you can interrupt with questions,
one-click decks and auto-infographics, all free. Building a worse version of a
free Google feature serves nobody, and it was never the interesting part of
Curious Astronaut. One factual blocker to know if anyone revives the audio half:
**Anthropic has no TTS** — the model writes the script (the lecturer already
does), but speech needs a separate vendor regardless, which is exactly what
the Podcastfy/Edge TTS line always was, so "just use our LLM provider" does
not work. What survives is the slides item above, which reuses the
figure-mining work instead of paying for generated graphics. Kept here rather
than deleted so the plan doesn't get re-proposed.

## Data & tech

- **Academic graph:** two interchangeable providers, chosen per graph in the
  header — [Semantic Scholar](https://api.semanticscholar.org/api-docs/)
  (arXiv-native ids, SPECTER2 embeddings, `tldr` summaries; ~1 req/sec on the
  free key) and [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org/) (server-sorted `cites:`
  queries — true top-cited landmarks). See
  [docs/citation-coverage.md](docs/citation-coverage.md) for each one's honest
  limits.
- **Offline S2 citations corpus (optional):** the bulk Datasets releases
  (papers + 2.4B citation edges) ingested via DuckDB → Parquet — citations
  hash-partitioned, papers clustered by `corpusid`, citer queries two-phase
  (`integrations/semantic_scholar/corpus/`, `astronaut corpus` CLI; hundreds of GB,
  on its own drive outside the repo). Serves the all-history landmark rankings
  the live S2 endpoint can't; builds fall back to the live path automatically.
- **Seed discovery:** provider-native paper search (S2 relevance search /
  OpenAlex `search=`) with LLM query expansion, served cache-first from local
  snapshots.
- **Graph renderer:** [`react-force-graph-2d`](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph)
  (canvas force-directed with custom node painting; Force ↔ Timeline layouts).
  Sigma.js + graphology remains the fallback if we ever need very large graphs.
- **AI teacher:** a **PydanticAI agent crew** (librarian /
  lecturer / researcher behind a deterministic orchestrator), streaming
  end-to-end over SSE. Each agent picks its own vendor — Anthropic, OpenAI
  (or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), Google, or local **Ollama** — so the
  teacher no longer requires a paid key (v7.13.0; see
  [docs/history.md](docs/history.md)).
- **Local library (bring-your-own sources):** PDFs/URLs chunked and embedded
  **locally** (sentence-transformers + sqlite-vec, hybrid FTS5+vector
  retrieval via RRF) — copyrighted books never leave the machine.
- **Slides (roadmap):** generated by the existing agent crew from lecture beats
  + the figures already mined from open-access PDFs — no new vendor.
  *(Audio via Podcastfy/Edge TTS and the AutoContent API media tier were both
  retired 2026-08-16; see the feature stack.)*
- **Storage:** SQLite in `data/` for the day-TTL cache, saved sessions, and
  the library index — plus the optional Parquet corpus above. All gitignored.

### Reach & access

> The mission-critical theme (see [Why it exists](#why-it-exists--and-what-that-means-for-this-list)).
> Everything here is about somebody who cannot currently use Curious Astronaut at all —
> because of cost, because of setup, or because they never found it. None of
> these are hard problems. They are just the ones that were never prioritized,
> because the backlog was implicitly sorted by what was interesting to build.

- [ ] **Make first-run possible for someone who is not a developer** — today
      the path to a running Curious Astronaut is: install mise, run a setup script that
      wants Python 3.14 / uv / Node / trivy, `uv sync --all-groups`, `npm
      install && npm run build`, hand-copy `config.example.json` to
      `config.json`, then find and paste API keys. Every one of those steps is
      reasonable for the person who wrote them and a wall for a student who
      just wants to learn something. **This is a reach problem wearing the
      costume of a polish problem.**

      **Scoped 2026-08-28 in [docs/first-run.md](docs/first-run.md) — read it
      before building.** The measurement there reframed the ticket: the install
      was 1.0 GB where the core app needs 83 MB of it, because every optional
      capability (library-source embeddings, PDF mining, the S2 corpus) was a
      mandatory dependency.

      **Step one shipped in v7.15.0** — those three capabilities are now
      `[project.optional-dependencies]`, so a core install is 83 MB (see
      [docs/history.md](docs/history.md)). That was the pure-subtraction step
      every distribution shape needed first. **Step two shipped in v8.1.0** — the
      `FileNotFoundError: …/lib/python3.14/config.example.json` that a
      non-editable `pip install .` used to die on is fixed: `PROJECT_ROOT` now
      resolves two ways, repo root in a checkout and a `platformdirs` per-user
      dir once installed, and the built frontend ships inside the wheel. So
      **`pip install curious-astronaut` + `astronaut serve` already works** —
      what is left of this ticket is everything that isn't Python packaging.
      Note this also corrects one assumption below — a missing `config.json` is
      **already** created from the example, so neither a fresh checkout nor an
      install needs a config step.

      **The options, kept here in summary:** A **Docker image** is the
      obvious one (a single `docker run`, no toolchain at all) and its cost is
      the torch/CUDA question the README already documents plus image size. A
      **prebuilt release artifact** is cheaper but still assumes Python — and
      it is *done*: 8.3.0 is on PyPI (2026-09-27), so `pip install
      curious-astronaut` is a real one-liner for anyone who has Python. A
      **guided first-run** that writes `config.json` for you, rather than
      requiring a hand-edit, is small and helps regardless of which of the
      other two wins. Note the config step is the one that *must* be solved
      either way: `config.py` is `extra="forbid"`, so a hand-copied file that
      drifts fails startup with a stack trace — the worst possible first
      impression. (The provider work this was sequenced behind shipped in
      v7.13.0, so a one-command install no longer has to end at a paid API
      key — a guided first-run should offer the keyless Ollama path.)
      *(Filed 2026-08-16.)*

- [ ] **Nowhere to try it, and nowhere that explains it** — Curious Astronaut is public on
      GitHub with a thorough README, and that reaches developers who already
      read READMEs. It reaches nobody else. There is **no demo, no screenshot,
      no recording, and no hosted instance** — so the only way to find out
      whether the graph-plus-teacher idea is any good is to install it, which
      is the thing the ticket above says is hard. An open-source project that
      nobody can evaluate serves the same number of learners as a private one.

      **The cheap end is disproportionately effective and should come first:**
      screenshots and a short screen recording in the README, showing a lecture
      playing while the graph lights up node-by-node. That is the single most
      convincing thing the app does and it is currently described only in prose.
      **A hosted instance is the expensive end** and carries a real problem
      worth stating before anyone tries: the teacher needs an API key, so a
      public demo means *paying for strangers' tokens*, with no rate-limit
      story and an obvious abuse surface. Options if it's ever wanted:
      bring-your-own-key in the browser, a graph-only demo with the teacher
      disabled (the explorer is already keyless and it demos well), or a
      recorded walkthrough that costs nothing to serve. The recording is
      probably the honest answer. *(Filed 2026-08-16.)*

- [ ] **Say what the app is on the home page** — the landing surface is the
      astronaut picture, "What do you want to explore?" and the composer.
      That's inviting if you already know what Curious Astronaut does, and
      says nothing if you don't: a first-time visitor isn't told that it
      draws a citation and similarity graph from Semantic Scholar, or that
      the assistant can teach a field's history and answer from your own
      sources. The sibling of the ticket above, but **inside the app** and
      free to build. It's the first thing anyone who does get it installed
      will see. Keep it short (a line or two under the greeting, or a few
      "try this" prompts that show by example) so the empty landing stays
      calm, and make it disappear once a conversation starts, like the
      greeting does. Start from the `landing` branch of the empty-chat
      render in `frontend/src/teacher/Teacher.tsx` (`.landing-greeting`) and
      its styles in `teacher/teacher.css`; the theme-switch replay effect
      there animates `.landing-hero` and `.landing-greeting`, so a new
      element should join it. Mind the in-app help rule: the tour's first
      step may already say some of this. *(Patrick, filed 2026-10-06.)*

      **First attempt, reverted 2026-10-06:** a paragraph under the greeting,
      Asta-style (bold pitch, plain detail). Patrick: the page looked better
      without it, because the landing works by being quiet. So the
      description should live *off* the landing surface. Options on the
      table, in order of preference: (1) a welcome step at the start of the
      home tour, which auto-runs on first launch, the exact moment and
      audience; (2) a muted "What is this?" link under the bar that opens
      it in a popover (and could later hold example queries); (3) a
      one-line tagline under the rail wordmark (now helmet + Fredoka,
      v8.12.0 — a tagline would sit under it); (4) not the placeholder, which already teaches `@`. 1+2
      pair well. Copy from the attempt: **"A map of any research field,
      with a guide who knows its history."** Curious Astronaut draws the
      citation graph around a paper from Semantic Scholar or OpenAlex. Its
      assistant answers from those papers and from your own books and PDFs,
      citing each, or lectures on how the field got where it is.

### Teacher & agent reach

- [ ] **The reroute-to-lecture correction should keep the framing the reader
      asked for** — with the `/lecture` command gone (v7.23.0), the only ways
      to name a lecture's framing are the words in the message (the router's
      keyword rule on the fast path, the classifier's prompt otherwise). The
      one path that ignores them is the **"Lecture it instead"** correction on
      a turn the router sent to the researcher: `useConversation.ts`'s
      `reroute` hard-codes `'summary'`, so *"what's the story of these
      papers?"* misrouted to an answer comes back as a summary when corrected,
      and the reader has to re-ask with the word "history" in it. The fix is
      small: re-read the framing (and the scope, for the same reason) off the
      original question — either by calling `/api/route` again with a
      "target is settled" hint, or by exposing the router's `_HISTORY_WORDS`
      rule on the frontend. Not worth a model call on its own; fold it into
      whatever next touches the reroute. *(From Patrick, 2026-09-15, while
      handing off v7.23.0: "that's okay for now".)*

- [ ] **Click a library citation to open the source at that page** — Part 2 of
      the citation ticket whose Part 1 shipped in **v6.6.0** (see
      [docs/history.md](docs/history.md)). Citations now *resolve*: the model
      writes `[S1, p.243]`, the server hands the frontend a real source id, and
      the reader sees *"(Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, p.460)"*. What's
      missing is the click — it renders as quiet grey text, not a control.
      **The blocker is that there is no page viewer, which the original ticket
      wrongly assumed existed:** the only source-image route is
      `/api/sources/<id>/figure/<n>`, which serves one *mined manifest entry*,
      and nothing in the frontend displays an arbitrary page. Two halves:
      **(a) backend, small** — `pdf/floats.py`'s `render_float` already
      rasterizes a clipped page region via PyMuPDF, so a whole-page render is
      the same call without the clip; add `/api/sources/<id>/page/<n>`.
      **(b) frontend, a new surface** — decide how a page is shown (a lightbox
      like `FigCard`'s? a docked reader?), which is the real design work here.
      Then make `.source-ref` a button. Note the page-render path has no
      caption-anchoring dependency, so unlike figure mining it works on any
      PDF-backed source — but URL sources have no stored PDF and must degrade
      to nothing clickable — but should still get the link-blue treatment, so
      a library citation reads like a paper citation either way. **Supersedes**
      the frontend prose-highlight bandaid, built and then removed 2026-07-24 —
      that highlight could never be clickable without the structured reference
      v6.6.0 added. (Also absorbed, 2026-10-02, the UI theme's highlight-only
      "Highlight inline library-source references like paper links" ticket of
      2026-07-19, which predated both.)
      *(From #2 of the 2026-07-24 front-end quick-wins pass.)*
- [ ] **The guard is gated on a field the model writes** — a known weakness in
      `_must_have_looked`, kept here because the guard itself is core: it only
      fires on an `answered` turn, and `kind` is self-reported, so labelling a
      real question `conversational` would skip the library unchallenged.
      **Never observed** — it was the first suspect when a v6.7.0 answer
      skipped the search, but the log said `kind=answered` and the real cause
      was elsewhere (`docs/bugs.md`). Narrowed pre-emptively in v6.7.1
      (`answered` is the prompt's default; any question on any subject
      qualifies). Watch with `grep 'answer kind=' data/curious-astronaut.log` — a
      `conversational` line on a turn that clearly asked something is the
      signal. If it ever does slip, the lever is a cheap pre-classifier
      deciding the kind before the researcher runs, so the answering model
      can't grant itself the exemption (`summarizer` is the pattern).
      Related gap, unbuilt: a user can say *"answer from your own knowledge,
      don't search"* and nothing expresses that — with a library in scope the
      guard would override an explicit instruction.
      *(Filed 2026-08-06; scope-trimmed 2026-08-08.)*
- [ ] **Reconcile when the researcher should search vs. expand** — the agent has
      two "reach beyond the graph" tools with fuzzy boundaries: `expand_node`
      (a lineage hop — references/citations/similar of a paper *on* the graph) and
      `search_papers` (free-text, off-graph). **Now three**, since v6.7.0 made
      `search_sources` (the user's own library) a first-class reach on every
      turn rather than a pre-answer retrieval — so the decision rule has to
      cover all three, and the library one is the only one with a hard rule
      already attached (it must run before a substantive answer).
      Their prompt guidance overlaps, so
      the model sometimes searches when a hop would be tighter (or vice versa),
      wasting budget and pulling noisier nodes. Sharpen the tool descriptions /
      skill prompt on the decision rule (expand = "trace a known paper's
      neighbors"; search = "reach recent/topical work no hop can"), and consider a
      cheap heuristic nudge. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-14.)*
- [ ] **"Render page region" fallback for uncaptioned inline diagrams** — the
      v5.28.0 figure miner is caption-anchored, so a diagram with no caption
      (Sutton & Barto's inline backup diagrams; pseudo-code "figures" in very
      old PDFs) has nothing to anchor on and correctly reports "not
      extractable" — the one honest gap left after the Sarsa(λ) fixes. A
      fallback could let the agent show such a diagram anyway by rendering a
      *page region* rather than a manifest entry: e.g. a
      `show_source_page(source_id, page)` tool (whole page, or the page's
      largest drawing neighborhood via the existing cluster machinery), traded
      against the risk of shipping half a page of body text as an "image".
      Needs a crop heuristic that doesn't reintroduce the mislabeling problem
      the caption echo just fixed — the tool result must say exactly what's
      being shown ("page 87 of X", not a figure designation). *(Filed
      2026-07-19, out of the v5.28.0 browser tests.)*
- [ ] **Investigate: no figures extractable from the Feynman Lectures Vol. 3** —
      the library figure miner comes up empty on *Quantum Mechanics* (Vol. 3),
      so the librarian can't show anything from it. Unknown yet whether this is
      the known caption-anchoring gap (the ticket above — a book whose figures
      are captioned in a form `CAPTION_RE` doesn't match, e.g. "Fig. 3–2" with
      an en-dash, or captions set as running text rather than their own block),
      a text-layer problem (the volume may be a scan, or have figures drawn as
      vector art the cluster machinery discards), or an ingest-side failure.
      **Start by looking, not fixing:** dump the mined manifest for the source
      and compare against the actual pages — if captions are present but
      unmatched it's a regex/anchor fix; if the page has no text layer it's the
      OCR question (deliberately dropped, 2026-07-16); if the drawings are
      filtered out it's the float-geometry constants. See
      [docs/pdf-mining.md](docs/pdf-mining.md) before touching
      `services/pdf` — the storage decisions there are settled.
      **Narrowed 2026-07-19 (browser round):** the v6.1.1 hyphen fix to
      `captions.split_label` did *not* help, and neither did re-uploading the
      volume — so it's neither a stale manifest nor (only) caption labelling.
      The chip now reports the honest failure ("Tried figure 1 on p.72 of
      the_feynman_lectures_vol_III_quantum_mechanics"), which means the miner
      is returning **no floats for that page at all** — the caption anchor
      never matched, or the page's drawings were filtered out before captions
      were considered. Next step is still to dump the manifest for the source
      and compare against the PDF; if the manifest is empty everywhere, the
      question is whether the volume has a text layer at all.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-19.)*
- [ ] **Images from HTML sources never reach the chat either** — the same
      user-visible symptom as the Feynman ticket above ("the assistant can't
      show me a picture from this source"), but a **different pipeline**, so
      don't assume one fix covers both: that one is PDF float-mining in
      `services/pdf`, this one is whatever the HTML ingest path does with
      `<img>`. Repro Patrick is using: the **Wikipedia "Black hole" article** —
      image-rich and public, so it makes a good fixture. **Questions to answer
      before designing anything:** does HTML ingest extract images at all, or
      only text? If it records them, where do they live — note
      [docs/pdf-mining.md](docs/pdf-mining.md) settles that images are
      *deliberately* never cached server-side for PDFs, and that reasoning may
      or may not carry to remote URLs we could simply hot-link. And can
      `show_source_figure` even address a non-PDF source, given it's
      page/manifest-shaped today? Start by ingesting the article and dumping
      what the source record actually holds — the same "look before fixing"
      discipline the Feynman ticket calls for. Also worth checking whether the
      honest-failure trace chip fires here, or whether it fails silently; the
      latter would be its own bug. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-09.)*
- [ ] **A precise "overlapping references/citations" skill for the researcher** —
      asking which references or citations the seed paper SHARES with an
      expanded paper kind-of works today, but the answer comes from the model
      eyeballing the graph and reads imprecise. Give it a real tool: a
      deterministic overlap computation (intersect the two papers' reference/
      citer sets server-side — the graph and the expansion data already hold
      both) exposed as a researcher skill, so the answer is exact set output
      rather than model recall. Probably wants the result grounded as
      highlightable node lists too. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-18.)*

- [ ] **Scope a thread to its own set of library sources** — today the
      source scope is one global set, and the scope filter will get unwieldy
      as the library grows. Let a thread pin a subset of sources, picked from
      the Library modal (a tab or section for it) or from the thread itself,
      so each thread's assistant only reaches the sources that matter to it.
      Decide what a new thread inherits (everything, or its exploration's
      choice). *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-10-09.)*

### Citations & graph data

- [ ] **A real switch between the corpus and the live S2 API** — today the
      choice is **implicit, config-driven, and silently per-seed**. There is no
      flag: `corpus/source.py`'s `active_source()` (`:477-500`) hands back a
      `DuckDBCitationSource` only when `config.storage.s2_corpus` is set *and*
      the directory exists *and* `CURRENT` names a release *and* that release
      has papers Parquet — any gate failing returns `None` and
      `citation_relations` (`:573-578`) falls through to live. It then falls
      back **again, per build**, when the seed doesn't resolve to a corpus id,
      so two seeds in the same session can quietly come from different sources.
      `services/graph/build.py:178-194` picks corpus-first and stamps the
      outcome as `citation_source: "corpus" | "live"` on the `Graph`
      (`model.py:118`), which the UI surfaces **read-only** through
      `landmarkNote(provider, graph?.citation_source)`
      (`GraphExplorer.tsx:591`). So the app already *tells* you which source it
      used — it just gives you no way to *ask* for one.

      **Today's only control is a path, not a switch**: SettingsModal's
      "Citations corpus" text field (`:509-528`, hint "Empty = corpus off").
      Forcing a live comparison means blanking the field — and losing the path
      you'd have to retype to get back. That's the actual pain: A/B-ing corpus
      against live is a routine thing to want (the corpus can only ever be as
      fresh as its release, and the live endpoint has the newest citations),
      and it currently costs a settings round-trip in each direction.

      **The design question is scope**, and both precedents already exist. A
      **per-request** choice would mirror the S2/OpenAlex provider picker —
      a `?provider=`-style query param read in `routes/graph.py:67-77`, with
      `resolve_provider`'s degrade-to-default behaviour (`build.py:98-119`) as
      the model — and is the more useful shape for comparison, but it widens
      every graph/search/agent call site that already threads `provider`. A
      **config default** (`providers.s2.prefer_corpus`, say) is a much smaller
      change and enough if the goal is just "pin me to live for this session".
      Worth deciding *before* building, since the per-request version
      subsumes the other. Either way, keep the automatic fallback: a seed the
      corpus can't resolve must still build from live rather than fail.

      **The cache catch:** the graph cache is keyed by `(provider, seed)` and
      **not** by citation source, so a live build would be served the corpus
      snapshot (or vice versa). v6.3.0's `BuildShape.cache_suffix()` is the
      pattern — a suffix that's empty on the default path and distinguishing
      otherwise.

      **Sequencing (Patrick, 2026-08-09): after the S2-corpus
      landmark-citation research lands, not before.** A user-facing "use the
      corpus" switch is only worth exposing once the corpus path is
      known-good — shipping it while the corpus still returns a
      random-looking set of Field Landmarks just hands people a way to make
      their graph worse. Treat the research outcome as the gate.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-16; absorbed the UI theme's
      "Settings modal — the corpus vs. live-citations toggle" ticket, filed
      2026-07-16, on 2026-10-02 — same feature, filed twice.)*

- [ ] **Surveys as a first-class node kind** — a review/survey paper is a
      different animal from a primary result: it's the field's own overlook of
      a period, and right now it's an anonymous dot like everything else.
      Identify them, give them their **own node colour and filter chip**, and
      let the user **scope the researcher and lecturer to them** — "teach me
      this field from its surveys" is a genuinely different (and often better)
      first pass than the citation lineage.

      **The data is there and we simply don't ask for it**, which makes the
      first step small: S2 exposes `publicationTypes` (carrying `Review`) and
      OpenAlex a `type` field (`review`) — neither appears in
      `semantic_scholar/nodes.py`'s `NEIGHBOR_FIELDS` nor
      `openalex/nodes.py`'s `NEIGHBOR_SELECT`, so it's a field addition on both
      before anything else can be built. Worth checking coverage on a real
      graph first: if the flag is sparse or noisy, a title/abstract heuristic
      ("a survey of", "a review of", ": a survey") may have to back it up, and
      that changes the ticket's shape.

      **Then two halves.** *Rendering* — surveys aren't a graph *relation*
      (a paper is a survey regardless of how it reached the canvas), so this is
      an **overlay** on the existing relation colouring rather than a new
      relation, and the chip is a filter over a property, not over `rels`.
      That's a real difference from the sibling "filter chip for
      teacher-discovered and search nodes" ticket, which does filter `rels`.
      *Scoping* — the agents already accept a hand-picked node set
      (`selectedNodeIds` → `selectGroundingNodes`), so "only the surveys" could
      ride that existing seam rather than needing its own plumbing.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-14.)*

- [ ] **Replace the STOP/SKIP citation rules with a citation-threshold predicate**
      — the standing goal (Patrick, 2026-07-20). Rip out the STOP rule, the SKIP
      rule, truncated-vs-full-history, and adaptive-vs-non-adaptive, and replace
      all of them with a single **per-citer predicate** — something shaped like
      `is_landmark(citer) = citer.cited_by >= threshold(citer, seed)` — that reads
      one citer and never the pool, so it is order-free and provider-independent
      by construction. That collapses five behaviors to one, pushes the filter
      into the query (OpenAlex `cited_by_count:>N`, a corpus `WHERE`), and turns
      truncation into a caveat instead of a code path. Latest Publications becomes
      the complement; the sliders return as display-only trimming; `PER_YEAR_CAP`
      demotes from semantics to a default slider position; "Field Landmarks"
      becomes "Landmarks".

      **Restarting from scratch under the `research` process** (`.claude/skills/research`).
      A first fully-specified formulation
      (`citer.cited_by >= max(FLOOR, T[age] · S(seed))`, fit for a 20–40 landmark
      band) reached Phase 1 on the `citation-threshold` branch and was retired —
      but its **key finding must carry forward so we don't rediscover it the hard
      way:** a pool-independent predicate can *center* the landmark count but
      cannot *pin* it per seed. The required per-seed multiplier scatters ~1.9–2.5×
      around anything seed size predicts, while a 20–40 band is only ~1.65× wide →
      ~35% max in-band, an exhaustively-proven ceiling for that model family
      (independently reproduced). The lesson: a **count guarantee belongs in the
      display layer** (the sliders), not the predicate — the predicate owns the
      Landmark/Latest *split*, the sliders own *volume*. The `citation-threshold`
      branch survives with its fitted S2 corpus sample (1,502 seeds) for
      reference; fitting still runs on the **Windows** box (offline corpus),
      artifact travels back via git.

      **The success criterion, inherited from the SKIP spike this superseded**
      (Patrick, 2026-07-17): on a **truncated** pool — a hyper-cited seed on a
      machine with no corpus — whatever rule ships should land **as close as
      possible to what full-history STOP would ship if the seed's whole
      citation history were reachable**. Full-history STOP is the ground truth,
      so this is an approximation contest, not a taste question — and it is
      *measurable* with machinery we already have: `live_pool_validation`
      simulates the exact truncated pool from the offline corpus, so each
      candidate can be scored against the full-history band (overlap on the
      reachable intersection, plus count agreement) across the 58-seed corpus.
      **The honest ceiling on any rule's score is how much of the true band is
      reachable at all**, and the study's median 1.8× budget gap says that
      ceiling is often low. Where no rule can score well, **provenance
      labelling is doing the real work** — a truncated pool's "landmarks" are
      only ever "most-cited of the newest 9k", and saying so in the UI may
      matter more than the selection rule. Scope note (Patrick, 2026-07-19):
      the truncated path's *Latest* side moves with the adaptive Latest too,
      even if that leaves its landmark set very small.
      *(Goal filed 2026-07-20; restarted 2026-07-23; absorbed the superseded
      "Spike: is the SKIP rule what we actually want?" ticket, filed
      2026-07-17 and removed 2026-08-29.)*
- [ ] **Investigate forward references — references S2/OpenAlex date *after*
      the seed's publication** — both providers sometimes list a reference (a
      paper the seed *cites*) with a publication date later than the seed's
      own, which should be impossible and currently just renders where the date
      says (right of the seed on the timeline — an ancestor drawn in the
      future). Likely upstream dating quirks — revised/journal versions dated
      over the preprint the seed actually cited, or plain misdates — but
      investigate per provider before deciding: how common, whose date is wrong
      (the seed's or the reference's), and whether the graph should clamp,
      flag, or trust. If it's genuinely upstream, the finding belongs in
      `docs/bugs.md`'s Upstream half, justifying whatever guard ships. *(From
      the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-17.)*
- [ ] **Reevaluate how Latest Publications distribute across their bands — the
      spread should read more uniform, without a recency-bias pattern** — the
      per-year bands were built precisely so no single year dominates, but the
      on-screen result still shows a recency-leaning density Patrick wants
      flattened: each band ships its top `latest_per_year` by citations, and
      how *full* each year's band actually comes back varies enough that the
      frontier can still pile toward the newest years. Look at the shipped
      band-size distribution across real seeds first (all three implementations
      share the shape now — OpenAlex's per-year queries, the corpus's windowed
      query, the live complete-pool bands — so one fix should land in all
      three), then decide whether the answer is a per-band cap tweak, a
      different within-band ranking, or something like sampling toward
      uniformity. **The leading candidate for the within-band ranking is
      citation velocity** — balance citation count against recency, which are
      inversely related (newer papers haven't had time to accumulate
      citations), so neither extreme dominates. The stratified/per-year
      approach has been tried several times and the spread still isn't even;
      the shelved WIP's **`_velocity` helper — `citation_count / (age + 1)`**
      (see the mega-papers phase notes in `docs/history.md`; the `stash@{0}`
      it lived in no longer exists, so that formula is all that survives) is
      the starting formula, and may need tuning so the balance point lands
      where the spread looks even. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-17;
      absorbed "Even Latest-Publications spread via citation velocity",
      Patrick's brainstorm of 2026-07-10, on 2026-10-02 — one problem, filed
      twice.)*
- [ ] **`corpus activate` only checks papers — it will happily activate a corpus
      with no citation edges** — the guard is
      `if not paths.parquet_dataset("papers").exists(): raise`. It never looks at
      citations, and `ingest_release` does papers first (rebuilding the arXiv index
      as it goes), so a release can have a *complete* seed index and ~0% of its
      edges. Then `corpus.citation_relations` resolves the seed, finds few or no
      edges, and returns `([], …)` — a valid tuple, **not** `None` — so `build.py`
      prefers the corpus and ships a graph whose Field Landmarks are a random
      sample of whichever shards happen to be done, labelled *"drawn from the
      offline citations corpus — the full citation history"*. Confirmed live on
      2026-07-15: with papers at 60/60 and citations at 2/390, DQN resolved and
      `citation_relations` returned **(60 landmarks, 0 latest)**. The empty case
      would at least announce itself; this one looks plausible and claims the
      strongest provenance we have. Two halves to fix: **(a)** `activate` should
      verify citations too (and the same hole is in `active_source()`, which only
      checks `parquet_dataset("papers").exists()`); **(b)** a resolved-but-edgeless
      seed should arguably fall back to live rather than ship an empty relation —
      needs a rule that can tell "no edges ingested" from "genuinely uncited".
      Related: the module docstring's "the app never queries a half-built corpus"
      only holds for a release that isn't active *yet* — re-ingesting an already-
      active one walks straight through it (documented in `corpus/README.md`;
      the workaround is to move `CURRENT` aside first). *(Found while re-ingesting
      the active release, 2026-07-15.)*
- [ ] **Latest Publications is thin on arXiv-only seeds — OpenAlex data
      gaps, not S2 offset paging** *(investigated 2026-07-10; the original
      suspicion is settled, the underlying problem is real and still open)* —
      **Verified: latest DOES come from OpenAlex** (every latest node in all
      four cached graphs carries an OpenAlex id; the logs show zero S2
      fallback engagements). But the instinct that something was off was
      right: **latest is badly truncated for arXiv-only seeds** — DQN's
      stops at 2025-08 (nothing from the last ~11 months), QMIX shipped just
      11 latest nodes. Two verified causes: (1) **OpenAlex splits papers
      into duplicate works** and `resolve_work` picks one — for QMIX we
      resolved the 352-citation twin while a same-DOI sibling holds 479, so
      `cites:` queries see half the paper; (2) **OpenAlex's citation linkage
      lags hard for preprint-only works** — even both QMIX works combined
      show ~34 citers since 2025 where S2 knows thousands (well-linked
      records like Attention/Hawking span cleanly to the build date).
      Remedies to build: union the `cites:` filter across all works sharing
      the seed's DOI/arXiv id (`cites:W1|W2`), and/or a per-relation S2
      supplement when the latest pool comes back suspiciously thin (the
      fallback is currently all-or-nothing on seed resolution). *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-09; findings 2026-07-10.)*
- [ ] **SPIKE: SPECTER2 semantic retrieval as a landmark source (not just
      Similar)** — a spike to investigate, **not yet a build decision**. Patrick's
      idea: use S2's SPECTER2 recommendations to surface heavily-cited **landmark**
      papers, as a workaround for the citation-coverage limits documented in
      [`docs/citation-coverage.md`](docs/citation-coverage.md). *(Discussed
      2026-07-13; picking up next session — full reasoning below so we don't
      re-derive it.)*

  **Why it's more than "reuse Similar."** It dodges **both** of our measured
  citation failure modes at once:
  - **S2's 10k ceiling + no sort** — `/recommendations/forpaper` is a *different
    retrieval mechanism* (SPECTER2 nearest-neighbors, up to 500, returned
    directly), so it has no offset-paging problem: a heavy hitter buried past the
    `_MAX_OFFSET`≈10k newest-first window is reachable by embedding when it isn't
    by citation paging (`integrations/semantic_scholar/traversal.py`).
  - **OpenAlex's missing ML citation edges** — the *real* open problem in the
    coverage doc (§3–4): OA under-extracts arXiv-preprint→preprint citations, so
    its ML landmark set is a different, lower-quality set (3/15 top-citer overlap
    on QMIX/MADDPG). **SPECTER2 embeddings don't need the citation edge to
    exist**, and they're computed over exactly the preprint-native corpus S2 is
    strong on — so semantic retrieval sidesteps the extraction gap entirely.

  **Free-lunch mechanic.** Recommendations already return `citationCount` (same
  `NEIGHBOR_FIELDS` we rank references/citations by), so **re-ranking the 500
  neighbors by citation count is zero extra calls** — the exact over-fetch-then-
  rank pattern `_neighbors` already uses. One call, no deep paging, no 429
  backoff, no OA dependency. Cheap regardless of the rest.

  **Motivating observation (Patrick).** Citation-ranked landmarks for a mega-seed
  drag in off-field applications — e.g. *Attention Is All You Need* → a
  transformers-for-protein-structure paper (AlphaFold-ish), which is really an
  application of ML in biology, not core ML. Semantic neighbors would stay closer
  to the field.

  **Honest caveats — it changes the question, so probably a complementary
  relation, not a replacement:**
  - **Loses directionality.** A citation landmark is a *descendant* (built on the
    seed); a SPECTER neighbor can be an ancestor (reference), descendant (citer),
    **or a sibling** (contemporaneous, no edge). So "semantic landmark" = "papers
    *near* this one", not "giants that *built on* this one." Fine for a
    Connected-Papers-style map (CP is co-citation/coupling-based, not direct-edge),
    but it **breaks the lecturer's timeline** ("how we got here" / "what evolved
    since" both depend on seed↔node time direction). Fixable by splitting the
    semantic set on publication-year-vs-seed, but not free.
  - **On-topic isn't unambiguously better.** *"Attention enabled AlphaFold"* is
    one of the most important things that paper did — cross-field impact is a
    **feature** of the citation graph, not noise. Filtering it out gives a cleaner
    field map but drops real impact signal.
  - **500-cap + era bias.** We get the 500 *nearest* then re-rank; a topically
    further-out landmark falls outside the pool (good = the AlphaFold exclusion;
    bad = can also drop a legit landmark). And embedding similarity clusters
    same-subfield/same-era, so it may be *worse* at surfacing deep-history
    foundational ancestors than the recent frontier.

  **Two plausible shapes (if the spike pays off):** **(A)** a parallel "related
  landmarks" relation — 500 SPECTER neighbors re-ranked by citations, top-N, shown
  distinctly (optionally year-split onto the timeline); **(B)** a *supplement* that
  unions the semantic top-N into the OpenAlex landmark set (deduped) specifically
  on the arXiv-native ML seeds where §4 showed OA is weak. (Note: this is a
  deliberate spike *despite* the v5.0.0 removal of the Similar relation (`docs/history.md`) — it
  reuses the recommendations API, which that ticket keeps wired for the
  researcher anyway.)

  **The experiment.** Same seeds
  (Attention, GPT-3, QMIX, DQN + a physics control like Hawking): pull SPECTER
  neighbors re-ranked by citations, then measure against (a) our shipped OA
  landmark set, (b) S2's true top-cited citers where pullable (the <9k-citer RL
  papers), and — **the key metric** — how many semantic neighbors are *verifiable
  citers OA missed* (resolve each id, check the edge). That last number is what
  distinguishes genuine landmark **recovery** from just a prettier Similar
  relation. Hits live S2 + OA, so keep it to a handful of seeds (shared IP).

- [ ] **Refresh the corpus incrementally instead of re-downloading it** — a
      monthly S2 release is re-pulled and re-ingested whole: ~400 GB of
      shards, then the full ingest (citations bucketed into 1024 partitions,
      papers compacted with a global `ORDER BY corpusid` sort) — hours of
      disk on NVMe and, per the corpus README's own measurements, ~10.6h of
      ingest alone on a spinning disk. Almost none of that is new: month over
      month the citation graph *appends*. **The investigation first:** the
      Datasets API is believed to expose a diff between two releases
      (update/delete file lists per dataset) — confirm that against the live
      API before anything else, since `datasets.py` today only calls
      `/release/latest` and `/release/{id}/dataset/{name}`, and the whole
      ticket rests on it. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-16 — Patrick's
      "is that possible? worth investigating".)*

      **If diffs exist, the ingest layout decides how hard this is, and the
      two halves differ sharply.** *Citations* are hash-partitioned on
      `citedcorpusid`, so an update file's edges scatter across all 1024
      buckets — appending is cheap in principle (write new files into each
      `bucket=<N>/`) but must preserve the within-bucket sort that makes row
      groups prune, so it's an append-then-merge per touched bucket, not a
      plain copy. *Papers* are the harder half: they are **globally sorted**
      by `corpusid` for exactly the pruning reason the README measures, and
      updated rows land anywhere in the 0–290M id range, so a naive append
      destroys the clustering that made hydration ~30x faster. That points at
      a re-compaction of the affected clustered files (which the existing
      `_compacting/` + `MANIFEST.json` staging already knows how to commit
      safely), plus a rebuild of the arXiv index.
      **Two constraints not to lose:** deletes are real (S2 merges and
      retracts records), so "append-only" is the wrong mental model; and
      releases are currently *isolated* subtrees with `CURRENT` naming an
      ingested one — an in-place incremental update mutates the release the
      app is serving, which is precisely the half-built-state hole the README
      warns about. Decide whether an incremental release copies-then-updates
      (cheap on a filesystem with reflinks, expensive otherwise) or whether
      `CURRENT` has to move aside for the duration.

- [ ] **Expand any paper on the Paper Graph, not just the seed** — a button
      (in the detail panel, probably) that pulls a non-seed paper's
      references and citations onto the **same graph**, without opening a new
      thread for it. The reader can then compare two papers' neighbourhoods
      side by side without asking the agent, which saves tokens; the agent's
      `expand_node` stays available. Reuse what `expand_node` already does
      server-side, and keep v7.5.0's rule: only real edges. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-10-09.)*
- [ ] **Show the citation edges between non-seed papers** — a toggle that
      draws the edges among the papers already on the graph (one reference
      citing another), not just the edges to the seed. Today finding these
      costs an agent run or a manual expand. The data is one batch of
      reference lookups for the papers on screen. Watch the cost on a big
      graph, and how many lines the canvas can take before it turns into a
      hairball. Related: "A precise overlapping references/citations skill"

### UI & rendering polish

- [ ] **Cross-tool thread references: how should `@thread` read a thread
      made of several tools?** — parked by Patrick 2026-10-09, when the
      broader "rethink the chat surfaces and threads" ticket was put to rest
      (he's happy with the exploration → thread → tool setup as it stands).
      What survived is one open question. `@thread` borrowing and the sibling
      index were built when a thread *was* its graph conversation. Since 5a a
      thread is a paper with several tools (the Paper Graph, the Knowledge
      Graph, and whatever comes next), so it isn't clear what borrowing
      "another thread" should mean: its graph conversation, its course
      progress, or both. **Settled meanwhile (v8.15.0): assistants are
      encapsulated per tool, and only the Paper Graph has one.** The cards and
      the Knowledge Graph dock nothing. Revisit when a second tool wants its
      own assistant, or when `@thread` starts to read wrong. Read
      `docs/history.md`'s v7.22.0 threads entry and the v8.15.0 entry first.

- [ ] **Draw the Curious Astronaut full-figure mascot properly** — the
      **helmet mark is done and usable** (favicon, app tile, dock) and nothing
      is blocked on this. What is *not* done is the whole-body character: three
      passes produced a figure Patrick called "terrible," and the honest read
      is that it needs an illustrator's eye rather than another round of
      hand-tuned SVG path math. **What went wrong, so the next attempt doesn't
      repeat it:**
      - **Limbs as uniform stroked capsules read as sticks.** Adding ball
        "mittens" at the ends helped but didn't fix it; real cuteness wants
        limbs that *taper*, which strokes can't do — they need to be filled
        paths.
      - **The raised waving arm fuses into the helmet.** With a chibi head
        (radius 15.5 of a 64 box) the dome reaches x≈47.5, so a stubby arm
        physically cannot clear it. The current workaround is a navy knockout
        clipped to the helmet circle, which *works* but is a patch over a
        posing problem. Consider: both arms low, or a smaller head, or the
        figure turned three-quarter.
      - **Same-fill shapes on a dark ground merge silently.** Every ivory
        element touching another ivory element becomes one blob. Any future
        pose needs collision-checking, or a consistent outline treatment.

      **Target:** the pudgy Reddit-avatar build — rounder body, no neck,
      tapered limbs, genuine negative space between parts. Reference and
      current state: <https://claude.ai/artifact/KxjPaM4yNcBNKLEK2fut8p>.
      Palette is settled and should not change (ivory `#F7F5F0`, glass
      `#12314A`/`#6FB6CE`, gold `#E8B44A`, ground `#0B1524`). *(Filed

- [ ] **Animate the rest of the UI — panels and the graph's find bar** —
      the sibling of "Animate the arrival of the graph" (below) and of the
      chat motion that shipped in v6.15.0. Patrick's examples: the
      **teacher's side panels** opening and closing, and the **graph's local
      search bar** (`graph/controls/FindBar.tsx`) appearing; the wider ask is
      *"animate everything"* — anything that today cuts between two states.
      Do it as **one motion language**, not per component: a shared duration
      and easing as CSS tokens, used everywhere, so the app moves with one
      voice. Every addition needs a `prefers-reduced-motion` path — several
      stylesheets (`shell.css`, `teacher.css`, `detail.css`,
      `settings.css`) already have one to extend. Start with an inventory of
      the cuts; some transitions can't be done in CSS (mount/unmount, `flex`
      shorthand changes) and need either a stay-mounted-and-hide approach
      or FLIP, so the inventory decides the cost. *(From the `todos.md`
      inbox, 2026-10-02.)*

      **In progress — the order Patrick picked (2026-10-06) from the
      inventory:** (1) shared motion tokens + popovers/menus ✓ and (2) the
      find bar ✓, both **shipped in v8.8.0**, with exits as well as
      entrances via `ui/usePresence` (see [docs/history.md](docs/history.md));
      (3) the assistant and detail panels ✓, **shipped in v8.9.0** — they
      slide by negative margin (`panel-in`/`panel-out`) so the canvas
      glides with them; (4) modals and folding sections ✓, **shipped in
      v8.10.0** — modals via `usePresence`, folds via `ui/Fold` (grid-row
      height), and the graph controls now fold away into a sliders button.
      (5) the thread/exploration switch ✓, **shipped in v8.11.0** — the
      canvas fades in on every explorer remount (fade-in only: a crossfade
      would mean two live explorers at once). Still to do: (6) the graph's arrival,
      which is its own ticket below. Use the `:root` motion tokens in
      `index.css` (`--ease-rise`/`--ease-fade`, `--motion-pop`/`-morph`/
      `-exit`/`-panel`/`-modal`/`-fold`/`-switch`), `usePresence` for anything that
      leaves, and `Fold` for anything that opens in place.

- [ ] **Cache indicators in search results: split "cached graph" from "cached
      search", and stop the badge outliving its cache** — the suspicion was
      right on both counts. The badge exists — it reads **"⚡ opens
      instantly"** (`search/useDirectSearch.ts:65`), not "instantly loads" —
      and it means exactly one thing: **a cached graph snapshot**, never a
      cached search. It's driven by `paper.has_graph` from the SSE `cached`
      frame (`useDirectSearch.ts:165`, `routes/search.py:233-238`), which
      `services/search/discovery.py:217-219` computes by scanning only
      `graph:v2:<provider>:` keys. Cached *searches* live under a separate
      `search:<provider>:…` prefix (`agents/traversal.py:166`) and feed **no
      indicator at all** — so the second half of the ask is new plumbing, not
      a relabel.

      **On expiry, the answer is "yes, but only at compute time."**
      `discovery.py:171` does gate the badge on `(now - created) <=
      config.graph.cache_ttl` (86400s), deliberately still letting expired
      snapshots supply *titles* — so the flag is honest when it's calculated.
      Three gaps make it dishonest afterwards:

      - **It's frozen into markdown and saved.** `instant` is computed once
        from the `cached` frame, re-applied at `useDirectSearch.ts:186`, and
        baked as plain text into the transcript answer, which is persisted
        with the session (`store/workspace.ts:269`). **Reopen a saved session
        days later and long-expired entries still promise "opens instantly."**
        Nothing re-evaluates it. This is the bug worth fixing first —
        **confirmed in the browser by Patrick, 2026-08-16**, so it's a real
        repro, not an inference from the code.
      - **Build shape is ignored.** `fresh_seeds` keys on the snapshot's
        `seed.id`/`arxiv_id` regardless of the key's `shape.cache_suffix()`
        (`discovery.py:168-175` vs `services/graph/build.py:374`), while the
        browser sends its own shape on every build (`api/graph.ts:149,188`).
        A snapshot cached under a *different* shape sets `has_graph=True` and
        the actual open is a cache miss — a false badge on a perfectly fresh
        cache.
      - **False negatives.** Scout-found papers never get the badge even when
        their graph is cached, and the whole pre-pass is skipped when a field
        filter is active (`routes/search.py:232`).

      **The data model doesn't distinguish the two kinds**, which is why this
      is more than a label: `storage/cache.py:32-38` is one table of
      `key, value, created_at` with no kind or expiry column — the only
      separator is the key prefix, a convention the storage README itself
      (`:76-82`) flags as fragile after the `v2:` incident. Settings blurs them
      too, describing "graph snapshots, search results and paper details" as
      one thing (`SettingsModal.tsx:379`) with a single all-or-nothing
      `drop_cache` (`routes/settings.py:294`). Worth noting one genuine
      oddity to decide on while here: paper TL;DRs are cached with
      `max_age=None` — **they never expire** (`routes/graph.py:392`).

      **Test gap:** `has_graph` is asserted only for the fresh case
      (`test/curious_astronaut/services/test_search.py:46,156`); nothing ages a snapshot
      past `cache_ttl` and asserts the badge goes away, though the aging helper
      already exists (`test/curious_astronaut/storage/test_cache.py:21-23`).
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-16.)*

- [ ] **An error in the chat can't be dismissed** — when a turn fails the
      message stays on screen with no way to clear it, so a single failed
      search or lecture leaves a red block sitting above every later turn.
      `workspace.error` is the shared surface (`store/workspace.ts` — "the
      shared search/graph overlay surface"), written by the graph and search
      paths and never cleared except by the next successful load, so the fix
      is an explicit `errorCleared` action behind a dismiss control rather
      than new plumbing.

      **Scope note:** the *"Graph build should survive S2 being down"* ticket
      (Enhancements & tech debt) already asks for a dismissible error, but as
      one half of a bigger behaviour — the other half being that the graph
      already on screen must be restored rather than left greyed out. This
      ticket is the affordance on its own, which every failing surface needs
      and which that ticket can then assume. Do this one first; it makes the
      other smaller. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-28.)*

- [ ] **Order streaming search results best-match-first, as they arrive** —
      results already stream: `useDirectSearch.ts` pushes each paper onto
      `found` and re-renders the turn on every hit, so the reader watches the
      list grow. But the order is **the scout's arrival order**, so the best
      match can appear fourth and stay fourth until the run ends. Patrick's
      ask is to re-sort on each arrival against the user's query, so the most
      relevant paper is on top from the first render instead of after the last
      one.

      **The open question is what "best match" means here, and it isn't
      obvious.** The scout issues several queries through its own tools and
      reports what it found; there is no per-hit relevance score to sort on
      today. Candidates: reuse the provider's own result ranking (S2 returns
      relevance-ordered hits per query, but merging *several* queries' lists
      loses that), a cheap lexical score against the raw query in the
      frontend, or have the scout emit a score per hit. The frontend option is
      the only one that costs nothing and is honest about being approximate —
      worth prototyping first, since the goal is *perceived* responsiveness,
      not a better final answer. **Whatever is chosen must be stable**: a list
      that reshuffles under the reader's cursor while they are trying to click
      row two is worse than one that appends. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-08-28.)*

- [ ] **Make it clear that a lone `@paper` leaves the map** — this ticket
      was filed against the 🔍 **Find papers** toggle, which v7.18.0 replaced
      with `@` mentions (see `frontend/src/mentions/README.md`), so its
      original fix — reword the toggle's tooltip — has nothing left to land
      on. **The concern survives the redesign, in a new place:** with a graph
      open, picking a paper from the `@` dropdown and sending it *alone*
      **re-seeds** — you leave the map you were reading — while the same pick
      inside a question keeps you there and grounds the answer. Nothing on
      screen says which of the two a send will do before you press Enter.
      Before building anything, check in the browser whether the dropdown or
      the transcript's lead line already makes this obvious; if it does,
      delete this ticket rather than polishing it.

      **Why re-seeding stays.** Removing it would remove a path: `goHome`
      dispatches `workspaceCleared()`, so "go home to open another paper"
      costs you the graph and any unsaved exploration. The work is wording,
      not gating. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-15; re-aimed at `@`
      2026-10-02.)*

      **What comes after it is its own ticket** — "Grow the map from a
      search hit, instead of only leaving it", below. Keep them in that
      order: this one explains what a lone mention does today, that one
      gives it a second mode.

- [ ] **Teach the visual vocabulary — what every colour and glyph means** —
      the app encodes a lot in colour and shape and explains almost none of it.
      The graph legend lists node colours by name (References, Field Landmarks,
      Latest Publications…) with no word on what the relation *is*; the two
      citation glyphs (one node lit = spotlight a paper already on the canvas,
      three nodes wired = build that paper's own graph) are explained only in a
      tooltip you have to hover to find; edge colour, edge thickness
      (influential citations), node size (citation count), the dashed ring
      (teacher-discovered) and the cyan selection ring are explained nowhere at
      all. **Two more surfaces joined the list since** *(Patrick,
      2026-08-16)*: the v7.8.0 **left rail** — its glyphs (✎ new graph, ＋
      save, 📚 library, ⚙, ☀/☾, ?) and the fact that the list under them is
      your saved graphs — and the **ask's own controls** (▽ Filters and the
      📚 source scope — a labelled chip row under the bar with no graph, bare
      icons on the Chat row with one, since v7.11.0; the 🔍 Find papers
      toggle that used to sit beside them became `@` in v7.18.0),
      which today only the tour explains, and the tour is a one-time read.
      The docked half is the sharper case: there they are icons and nothing
      else.

      **The ask:** one place that lays out the vocabulary. Candidates worth
      pricing against each other — a tour step (fits the existing help
      surface, but the tour is a one-time read and this is reference
      material); an expandable "what am I looking at" panel off the legend
      (discoverable exactly when the question occurs); or a help/? overlay.
      Reference material argues against the tour.

      **Do this after "A filter chip for teacher-discovered nodes"** (below),
      which adds a control this page would have to describe — documenting a
      vocabulary that's about to change is work done twice. It's also the
      reason to keep resisting new
      colours — the fewer arbitrary hues, the shorter this page is.
      *(Patrick's ask, 2026-08-15.)*

- [ ] **The references lecture keeps opening with "The story begins…"** — a
      verbal tic in HOW WE GOT HERE, and the reader sees it every time. Worth
      knowing before anyone starts: **it is not a string in the codebase** —
      grep finds nothing, because the lecturer is *writing* it. So the fix is
      in `lecturer/config.py`'s mode prompt, and the shape of it is a rule
      about openings rather than a banned phrase (ban the sentence and the
      model reaches for the next stock opening). The `teaching-voice` skill is
      the other candidate home, if the tic turns out to span modes rather than
      living in this one. Check the other three modes before deciding which.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-15.)*

- [ ] **The chat bar's two icons sit small inside their circles** — both
      buttons are the same 34px disc (`.teacher-ask > button` and its
      `.ask-clear` variant, `teacher.css`), which was the point; what's off is
      the *glyph inside* each. The send arrow is a 16px text character in a
      34px circle and the bin is a 19px SVG, and both read as undersized for
      the disc around them. Scale each up — the arrow via `font-size`, the bin
      via its `svg` width/height — and check the pair together rather than one
      at a time: they sit side by side, so what matters is that they look like
      the same weight of control, not that either hits a particular number.
      Watch the stop square (`.stop-glyph`, 9px) too — it shares the send
      button and has to grow with it or the hover swap will jump.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-14.)*

- [ ] **Animate the arrival of the graph** — the sibling of the chat-motion
      work that shipped in v6.15.0 (see [docs/history.md](docs/history.md)),
      and the bigger of the two. Today the landing→graph
      transition is a cut: the chat is the page, then the graph simply *is*
      there and the chat is a side panel. The ask is a **zoom-in fade into the
      graph while the composer glides out of the way to the side** — one
      continuous move that says the conversation became the map, rather than
      two surfaces swapping places.

      **Parked 2026-10-06.** A first cut lives on the local branch
      `feature/motion-graph-arrival` (one WIP commit, not pushed): the camera
      eases in from 0.55× to the fit over 900ms, the composer glides to its
      dock by FLIP over 700ms, and a temporary `?arrival=overlap` switch
      compares "hide until the layout settles, then zoom" against "zoom while
      it settles". Patrick wasn't sold on the look, so it's on hold — revisit
      the feel before choosing a mode.

      **What makes it feasible.** The Teacher element deliberately stays at a
      single position in the tree across the switch (v6.13.0) — only its class
      changes, `.teacher.landing` → docked — precisely so entering graph mode
      doesn't remount it. So the composer's journey is a style change on one
      persistent element, which is the one case CSS can actually animate. The
      catch is *what* changes: `width: 100%` + `flex: 1` + `padding` →
      `width: 340px` + `flex-shrink: 0` + a left border, plus an inner
      `width: min(720px, 100%)` reading column that has to narrow at the same
      time. Some of that transitions cleanly and some doesn't (flex shorthand
      changes don't), so the first task is finding the subset that does — or
      committing to a FLIP-style transform, which animates smoothly regardless
      but needs the before/after boxes measured.

      **The graph half.** `GraphExplorer` already has the hook: a one-shot
      `zoomToFit(400, 60)` latch fired from `onEngineStop` once the force sim
      settles (`fitDone`). A zoom-in entrance is that same camera move started
      from further out, plus an opacity ramp on the canvas — so the sequencing
      question is whether the fade waits for the sim to settle (clean, but the
      first layout tick is the slowest) or overlaps it (livelier, but the user
      watches nodes shuffle into place). Worth trying both; the honest answer
      may be that a settling graph is *worth* watching.

      **Constraints inherited from the ticket above:** one motion language for
      both, a `prefers-reduced-motion` path for everything added, and no
      re-animation on a *re-seed* — a graph already on screen being replaced is
      a different, quieter event than the first one arriving, and the
      transcript survives it on purpose. *(Patrick's ask, 2026-08-14.)*

- [ ] **A "quick answer" toggle for a run in progress** — the agentic sweep is
      thorough by construction: since v7.0.0 an `answered` turn consults every
      available source, and v7.1.0 has it follow the web's names back into the
      literature. That's right by default and sometimes not what the reader
      wants *right now* — they asked something small and are watching a
      full sweep run. **The ask:** a control in the chat, live during
      execution, that says "wrap up".

      **The mechanism already exists**, which is what makes this cheap: every
      tool answers `STEPS_EXHAUSTED` once the step budget is gone and the
      model lands the answer itself inside the same run — no cancel, no lost
      work. So "quick answer" is *zeroing `deps.steps_left` mid-run* rather
      than any new stopping machinery. **Two things to settle.** The
      coverage guard must not then bounce the answer for skipping a source
      — as of v7.1.0 it already stops demanding what a spent budget can't
      reach, so this composes, but it needs a test saying so *deliberately*
      rather than by luck. And the plumbing: the SSE stream is
      server→client only, so a mid-run signal needs a side channel (a second
      endpoint keyed on the run, or a cancellable flag in the deps the route
      can reach). Cheaper alternative worth pricing first: a "quick" flag sent
      **with** the question, which needs no side channel at all and may cover
      most of the want. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-15.)*

- [ ] **A filter chip for teacher-discovered nodes** — discovered papers
      (dashed ring, drawn when the researcher's `expand_node` attaches them)
      have no filter control and are **always shown**; `GraphControls`
      renders chips only for `REL_TYPES`. Give them a toggle alongside the
      relation chips so a busy post-Q&A graph can collapse back to the built
      neighborhood. *(The search-node half of this ticket went away in v7.3.0,
      which stopped drawing edge-less `search` nodes at all — the legacy pink
      only renders in old saves now. Its sibling "Rework the `search` node
      treatment" was retired 2026-10-02 for the same reason.)* *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-14; absorbs the former "search nodes as a
      filter chip" ticket, 2026-07-07.)*
- [ ] **Grow the map from a search hit, instead of only leaving it** — split
      out of the "a lone `@paper` leaves the map" ticket above *(Patrick's
      idea, 2026-08-15; its own ticket 2026-08-16 — it's a feature, not
      wording)*. Today a paper found by direct search can only **re-seed**:
      you leave the graph you were reading to go look at another one. But the
      provider knows whether an edge exists between that hit and the papers
      already on screen, and *"does this cite, or get cited by, anything I'm
      looking at?"* is one `traversal` call per candidate. Answered yes, the
      hit can join the current map **with its real citation edge** — turning
      search from a way out into a way to reach distant work.
      **The constraint it must respect:** the graph only draws edges somebody
      actually wrote (v7.5.0), so this adds a paper *and its real edge*, never
      a "related to" line — a hit with no edge to anything on screen still
      has nothing to attach to, and re-seeding stays its only offer.
      **Sequencing:** do the wording ticket first; this one changes what
      search *does*, and there's no point explaining behaviour that's about
      to gain a second mode.

- [ ] **Responsive layout + a collapsible icon side rail (mobile-friendly)** —
      the frontend assumes a wide desktop window; resizing squeezes the
      header until controls collide, and mobile is unusable. Patrick's
      sketch: much of the header (Library / Assistant / Sessions / data
      source…) collapses into a **hidden side panel behind a hamburger
      (☰)**, in the style of **Azure DevOps' left rail — icons visible in
      the collapsed strip**, one per function, expanding to labels.
      **Before building: ask Patrick for examples/images of the look he
      wants.** Substantial: touches the header, panel overlays, and the
      canvas-resize plumbing; probably lands in stages (desktop-narrow
      first, true mobile after). *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-18.)*

      **Half of this shipped as v7.8.0** — the rail exists, collapses to a
      56px icon strip, and swallowed the header outright, which was the
      sketch's whole left-hand side. (v7.11.0 added the Azure DevOps gesture
      the sketch was drawn from: drag the handle past the floor to fold it,
      drag the folded edge to bring it back.) What's left is the *responsive*
      half:
      the layout still assumes a wide desktop window, and nothing reflows or
      re-clamps as the window narrows. Re-price the remainder against
      the rail as built rather than against the original sketch.

- [ ] **Let a source be renamed after upload, so chat references are readable**
      — an uploaded source carries whatever name it arrived with, and in a chat
      citation that's often unreadable: a hashed PDF filename, or a URL slug for
      a web page. Give the library an **alias** — an editable display name set
      after upload — and render *that* wherever the source is named to the user
      (the `[Sn]` marker's resolved title, the trace chips, the library list).
      Pairs naturally with "Click a library citation to open the source at
      that page" (Teacher & agent reach): no point making a citation a
      control while the text inside it is a hash.
      **Design notes:** the alias is presentation-only — retrieval, embeddings,
      and the stored source id must not key on it, or renaming would invalidate
      the index. Keep the original name visible somewhere (tooltip, or beneath
      the alias in the library list) so a source stays identifiable. Worth
      deciding whether an alias also reaches the *agent* — the researcher sees
      source titles when it decides what to search, so a clearer name may help
      it too, but that makes the alias semantically load-bearing rather than
      cosmetic. Default to presentation-only unless there's a reason.

- [ ] **Light-mode relation colors — darker & higher-contrast** — the v6.2.0
      light/dark toggle deliberately left the *relation* palette unthemed (gold
      seed, blue references, green landmarks, pink search were chosen to read on
      either background, so only the neutrals flip). In light mode those read a
      touch washed out against the off-white; give the reference-type colors
      **darker, more contrasting** variants for light while keeping the soft
      off-white and grey neutrals. This revisits the "relation palette is not
      themed" call from that ticket — so it's a light-only override of the shared
      relation colors, not a full re-theme. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-20.)*

- [ ] **Default the theme to the browser's `prefers-color-scheme`** — v6.2.0
      deliberately did *not* read `prefers-color-scheme` (dark-first app; a light
      OS setting shouldn't silently hand a first-timer the alternative), seeding
      the opening theme from `ui.default_theme` instead. This flips that: for a
      browser with no saved choice, honor the OS preference by default. Decide
      how it composes with `ui.default_theme` — does the config default become
      the fallback when the OS expresses no preference, or does the OS win
      outright? — and keep the explicit ☀/☾ toggle authoritative once the user
      picks. Touches `ui/theme.ts`'s `readStored` / `applyConfiguredDefault`
      rule. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-20.)*

- [ ] **A startup discovery feed — hottest & latest papers** — the app opens to
      a bare chat bar; give it a landing **feed of papers to click into**, with
      a **tab switch** between *Hottest* (trending / recently most-cited) and
      *Latest* (newest) across all fields. Clicking a paper seeds its graph, the
      same as a search hit. **The hard part is the data, not the tabs:** neither
      S2 nor OpenAlex exposes a plain "trending" endpoint, so *Hottest across all
      fields* needs a defined signal (e.g. recent papers ranked by
      citation-velocity, or a curated set) and *Latest* a cross-field recency
      query — decide the source and its caching before building the UI. *(From
      the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-20.)*

- [ ] **Tidy the tour's ordering and card titles** — polish, not a bug: the
      steps teach the right things, they just **arrive in the wrong order**
      and some **card titles want renaming**. Explicitly *not* about length
      (Patrick, 2026-08-16 — "it's not the length of the tour") — no stop
      gets cut to save time. Both lists live in `tour/steps.ts`.

      **The ordering problem is the rail.** `HOME_TOUR` walks ask →
      direct-search → filters → **provider** → **library button** → library
      panel → assistant panel → **rail (saved graphs)** → **settings**, so it
      crosses from the rail to the centre and back: the four rail controls
      are visited in two groups split by a stop in the middle of the screen,
      and within the rail they don't follow the rail's own top-to-bottom
      order (saved graphs sit *above* the data source, but are taught last).
      `GRAPH_TOUR` already follows the eye (controls panel → find → detail
      panel → teacher) and is the smaller job.

      **The titles to re-read** are the ones that name a mechanism rather
      than what the reader gets: *"Release · Fit · Refresh · Clear"* (a list
      of buttons as a heading), *"How many of each"*, *"Open a paper"* (which
      targets the hint line, not a paper), *"Four lectures"* (a count that
      goes stale the moment a mode is added). One rule to hold: the bubble's
      title doubles as the **jump select** (see `tour/README.md`), so titles
      are navigation labels — they have to read well out of context, in a
      list, not just above their own card.

- [ ] **Show the paper inline on the card home** — needs clarifying with
      Patrick before building: the card header already shows the title,
      authors, year and TL;DR. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-10-09.)*
- [ ] **A new loading screen for the Paper Graph** — today a build is a
      spinner card with a progress bar over an empty canvas. Shape not yet
      decided. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-10-09.)*

### Enhancements & tech debt

- [ ] **Deleting a running thread or exploration resurrects it; a search in
      General once spawned a whole new exploration** — filed 2026-09-17 from
      Patrick's browser round on v7.26.0, deliberately *not* investigated
      yet: it was late. Two symptoms, probably one family of cause.
      (1) Delete a thread or an exploration **while its stream is still
      running** and "some funky behaviour starts": the deleted thread or
      exploration comes back. The likely shape: the stream keeps writing
      into the transcript keyed by the dead id (`streamStarted`/`turnStarted`
      target `byKey[key]` — see `store/transcript.ts` and `useConversation`'s
      captured `activeKeyRef`), and the autosave / `threadActivated` /
      browser-close outbox (`store/threadPersistence.ts`) then re-saves a
      record whose owner was removed, or `explorationRemoved` (which only
      deletes local ownership "so a pending save cannot resurrect a
      deletion", per its own docstring) isn't enough when the save is
      *already* in flight. (2) A **direct search sent from General** landed
      in a **brand-new exploration** with the search as its thread, instead
      of in the General thread of the one on screen — not reproduced yet;
      look at how `useDirectSearch` (no explicit key: `turnStarted(query)`
      resolves to `activeKey`) interacts with a thread switch or a fresh
      `newExploration()` at the moment of send. First step is a reliable
      repro of each with the Redux devtools open, then decide whether the
      fix is "a stream aborts when its owner is deleted" or "a save is
      refused for an owner that no longer exists" — both, probably. Check
      `docs/history.md`'s v7.22.0 threads entry and the v7.16.0 autosave
      entry for the invariants those were supposed to hold.
- [ ] **`astronaut corpus verify` mistakes a tidied-up release for a destroyed
      one** — deleting a release's `raw/` shards once its ingest succeeds is
      **supported and documented** (`corpus/paths.py`'s module docstring: "A
      release's `raw/` shards remain deletable the moment its ingest
      succeeds"), and Patrick did exactly that to the 2026-08-05 release on the
      Mac — 47 GB of Parquet left, `raw/` gone, `download.json` still listing
      all 455 shards `done`. Run `astronaut corpus verify` against that release now
      and `_inspect_shard` hits `not target.exists()` for every shard and
      reports **455 × "missing"**. With `--repair` it would then cheerfully
      **re-download all ~408 GB** — a spectacular answer to "please check my
      corpus is OK", on a release that is perfectly fine. (Reproduced offline
      against the real release, feeding `download.json`'s shard names in as the
      listing: 395/395 citations shards came back `missing`, no network needed
      — `_inspect_shard` short-circuits before it probes a size.)

      **The fix is a precondition, not a per-shard change:** `verify_release`
      should notice that the dataset's raw directory is absent or empty and
      return a distinct "raw shards deleted — nothing to verify, the ingested
      Parquet is what matters here" outcome, rather than a per-shard verdict.
      Worth deciding at the same time whether `--repair` should refuse (or
      demand confirmation) when the miss count is *everything*, since that
      shape is far more likely to be a tidied release than a corrupted one.
      Note `astronaut corpus download`'s behaviour on the same state is
      **correct and should not change** — shards gone means re-fetch, which is
      what "a re-ingest just means a re-download" promises.

      Shipped in v7.12.0 and found the same night; no data at risk, but the
      command is a footgun until this lands. *(Found 2026-08-16.)*

- [ ] **Exercise the corpus downloader's unproven recovery paths on Windows** —
      v7.12.0's guard is covered by 16 offline tests against a fake `urlopen`,
      but three paths have **never run against real S3**, and all three only
      fire on the rare/awkward cases the tests had to simulate: (1) the **416
      disambiguation** (`_settle_range_past_eof` — is a `.part` at/past EOF a
      complete shard to promote, or over-long garbage to discard?), (2) the
      **mid-verify URL refresh** (a 400-shard verify outliving the signatures
      it started with), and (3) **`verify --deep`** at full scale, which
      decompresses ~400 GB. The Mac can't test any of it — its raw shards are
      deleted (see the ticket above) — so this rides on the **Windows machine**,
      which still has its shards, or on the next monthly release pull.

      Cheap and worth doing in the same pass: run `verify` (fast, size-only)
      against a corpus whose shards are intact and confirm it reports a clean
      bill, since tonight's evidence that the shards *are* intact came from a
      hand-rolled `gzip -t` sweep rather than from the command itself. See
      `docs/bugs.md`'s "A dropped connection looks exactly like a finished
      download" for why each path exists. *(Found 2026-08-16.)*

- [ ] **Rename `integrations/` to `providers/`** — `src/curious_astronaut/integrations/`
      holds one subpackage per external data source (`semantic_scholar/`,
      `openalex/`, `arxiv/`), and "integrations" is the vaguer word for what
      they are: the app already says **provider** everywhere else — the
      `Provider` type, `resolve_provider`, `config.providers`, the header's
      "Data source" dropdown, the per-provider cache keys. One name for one
      concept. **Blast radius is wide but shallow:** the package is imported
      from routes, services, and every agent (`from ...integrations import
      openalex`), so it's a mechanical sweep plus the READMEs that name it
      (`src/README.md`'s map, `services/graph/README.md`, `agents/README.md`).
      Two things to check while doing it: `providers` is already a *config
      section* name, so make sure the docs distinguish the package from
      `config.providers`; and `arxiv/` is not a graph provider at all (it's an
      id parser and a category vocabulary), so decide whether it belongs under
      the new name or somewhere else before the rename cements it. *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-15.)*

- [ ] **The researcher is slow next to plain Claude or ChatGPT — find out
      why, then decide what to trade** — Patrick's read is that it's the web
      search; the evidence says it's the *shape of the run*, and the ticket
      should start from that rather than from the hunch. *(From the `todos.md`
      inbox, 2026-08-15.)*

      **What one real turn looks like** (`data/curious-astronaut.log`, 2026-08-15
      21:23–21:24, "what's new in quantum computing?"): ~31s wall clock for
      `searches=1 passages=6 paper_searches=3 web_searches=1 web_pages=8`.
      That is **three scout runs**, and a scout is not one call — the logged
      `find_papers` line shows a single run issuing four lookups (two
      searches, two `more_like` hops). So the turn is a Sonnet researcher
      taking a step, waiting on a Haiku sub-agent that is itself taking
      several steps, each waiting on a provider — **serial all the way down**,
      by construction: the scout's tools are `sequential=True` because they
      mutate shared deps, and the researcher's are too.

      **Why the comparison isn't quite fair, and where it still stings.**
      Claude answers from weights with one round-trip; this reads real
      sources and tells you which. That difference is the product, not a
      regression. But a reader doesn't experience "grounded" — they
      experience 31 seconds, and three of those scout runs may have been one
      question's worth of need.

      **Levers, roughly in order of value-per-risk.** (a) **Run independent
      tools concurrently** — `search_web` and `find_papers` for *different*
      needs don't touch each other's state; the sequential flag is about deps,
      and the parts that genuinely share deps are inside one scout, not
      across two. (b) **Show more, sooner** — the direct-search work proved
      the reader will happily watch a search that is visibly working
      (v7.6.0); the researcher already streams trace chips but sits silent
      through the long middle. (c) **Cap the fan-out** — three paper searches
      for one question may be the prompt's "one call is the floor, not the
      ration" landing too hard. (d) **Model tier per worker** — already Haiku;
      little left. **Measure before touching (a)**: instrument per-step
      timings so the split between model time, provider time and waiting is a
      number, not a guess. A prior latency complaint on this same path turned
      out to be six S2 429s from running keyless — worth ruling out first,
      every time.

- [ ] **Re-evaluate where the frontend lives and what its folder is called** —
      **it stays in this repo for now** (Patrick, 2026-08-09); this is about
      *placement and naming*, not extraction. `frontend/` is a generic name
      inherited from `npm create vite`, and it sits at the repo root as a peer
      of `src/` — which reads oddly now that the backend is a proper src-layout
      package (`src/curious_astronaut/`) and the frontend is the larger of the two trees.
      Options worth weighing: rename in place (`web/`, `ui/`, `app/`, or
      something brand-specific); move it under a shared parent so the two halves
      are visibly siblings (`packages/`, `apps/`); or leave it and just write
      down *why*, which is a legitimate outcome. **What makes this
      non-trivial** is the blast radius of a rename — `frontend/` is named in
      `.pre-commit-config.yaml`'s two hook patterns, `noxfile.py`'s `vitest`
      session, both `bin/setup` scripts, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
      `.gitignore` (`frontend/dist/`), the Flask static-serving path, and a
      good deal of prose across `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the READMEs
      themselves. Do it as one mechanical sweep with the gate green on both
      sides, or not at all — a half-renamed tree is worse than either end
      state. Note the packaging work (v8.1.0) got there
      first: `frontend/dist` is now named in `hatch_build.py` and in
      `pyproject.toml`'s `artifacts`/sdist `include` lists as well, so a rename
      has two more call sites than it did. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-08-09.)*
- [ ] **Scrub the STOP/SKIP docs & memories once citation-thresholding supersedes
      them** — a deliberately-deferred cleanup, **gated on** the "Replace the
      STOP/SKIP citation rules with a citation-threshold predicate" ticket
      (Citations & graph data) actually landing. While STOP/SKIP still ship, their
      docs stay accurate and must remain. The moment the predicate replaces them,
      a large body of material goes dead at once and should be revised in one
      pass: `docs/landmark-vocabulary.md` (STOP/SKIP/tau/anchor — most of it),
      `docs/predict-vs-compute.md` (its whole regime table is about the rules
      being replaced), the STOP/SKIP/tau rows in `docs/constants.md`, the relevant
      `docs/configuration.md` prose, and the STOP/SKIP-era memories. `history.md`
      and `bugs.md` stay **verbatim** as always. (The 2026-07-22/23 research-reset
      scrub already retired the *model/pipeline* material; this ticket is the
      *rules* half, which couldn't go until the rules do.) *(Filed 2026-07-23.)*
- [ ] **Audit every constant in `src/` for config-knob-worthiness — then decide
      which knobs belong in the UI instead** — a systematic pass over the
      module-level constants (`NBUCKETS`, `_RANK_POOL`, `_MAX_OFFSET`,
      `PER_YEAR_CAP`, `_LATEST_WINDOW_MONTHS`, `UNBOUNDED_LANDMARK_CAP`, the
      retrieval/chunking numbers, agent extras defaults, …) asking of each:
      should this be a `config.json` knob? The audit needs the lesson the
      v6.0.0 count-caps purge taught as its filter — knobs nobody turns are
      *deletion* candidates, so "could be configurable" is not the bar;
      "someone would actually turn it, and turning it is safe" is.
      Fitted constants (`PER_YEAR_CAP`, `tau`/`max_span`) and API-reality
      constants (`_MAX_OFFSET` is what S2 serves, `NBUCKETS` is baked into the
      ingested corpus layout) probably stay code. **Part two, a separate pass
      once the knobs settle:** decide which config knobs graduate out of the
      file entirely and live **with the user** in the settings modal (shipped
      v6.1.0 — this pass feeds it a candidate list). End state worth aiming at: config
      holds operator concerns (paths, keys, ports), the modal holds user
      preferences, and code holds fitted or structural constants. *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-17.)*
- [ ] **Gate research notebooks — nothing executes them, so they rot silently**
      — a committed notebook output is a *claim*, and nothing checks it. Under the
      old (now-deleted) `research/` layout, two of three notebooks had been
      un-executable since the src-layout migration and nobody noticed, because no
      nox session runs a notebook; `precommit` lints notebook *identifiers*, which
      makes them feel covered while their correctness is checked by no one (see
      `docs/bugs.md` → "Two of the three research notebooks had been un-executable
      for weeks"). **Carry this forward into the rebuilt research** (the
      `research-reset` restart): whatever notebook lives beside a fitted artifact
      needs a `notebooks` nox session running `jupyter nbconvert --execute` over
      it. **The design question that stops it being a one-liner:** the gate must
      never hit a live API or need the corpus machine, so it needs a rule for
      what's includable (offline, committed inputs only) and a per-notebook opt-out
      rather than globbing everything — and the pipelines' **collectors** (which
      call live APIs) stay uncovered for the same reason. Fold this into the
      research-rule decision before rebuilding the pipeline plumbing. *(Found while
      renaming the budget vocabulary, 2026-07-16; re-scoped for the restart
      2026-07-22.)*
- [ ] **Swap the hand-rolled `urllib` clients for `httpx`** — S2, arXiv
      (`client`/`fulltext`/`figures`), and OpenAlex all hand-roll stdlib
      `urllib` (manual `Request`/`urlencode`/`HTTPError` plumbing); only HF uses
      a library, and that's the `huggingface_hub` *SDK*, not a generic HTTP lib.
      The original "no third-party HTTP dep, tiny deploy" rationale (baked into
      the S2 client docstring) is now **moot**: `httpx` (0.28.1) is already in
      the tree transitively via anthropic/pydantic-ai, so adopting it for our
      clients adds **zero new install** — and it's more readable
      (`client.get(url, params=…).json()`, `raise_for_status()`,
      `resp.status_code`), gives connection pooling, and makes the three REST
      clients consistent with each other and with the httpx the app already
      runs on. **Keep** our own throttle-lock + backoff + error-taxonomy
      wrappers (the load-bearing logic a library doesn't replace — so the win is
      readability/consistency, not less retry code). **Don't** adopt provider
      SDKs (`pyalex`, `semanticscholar`): they'd hide the throttle/cache/paging
      control we deliberately own. Before building, pin to the real `httpx` and
      check what's pulling the odd `httpx2` (2.5.0) in the lockfile. *(From a
      session design question, 2026-07-09; staged behind the OpenAlex hybrid
      ship.)*
- [ ] **Tune the agents' citation-count weighting via a skill** — today a strong
      preference for highly-cited papers is *implicit*: the graph hands both
      agents a pool already ranked by citations (references/citations most-cited
      first in `build.py`; `expand_node` pulls landmark/most-cited neighbors; the
      lecturer's figure pool is `sorted(by citation_count)[:4]`), while the
      prompts only *show* the count (`node_lines`) and `teaching-voice` pushes
      "why it matters" over popularity — no explicit rule either way. Add an
      optional skill that makes the weighting **explicit and adjustable** (favor
      or deliberately de-emphasize citation count in what the agents select and
      narrate), so we can experiment with surfacing under-cited but important
      work. Low-effort: a skill-file addition wired into the researcher/lecturer
      `SKILLS` tuples. *(From a session side-question, 2026-07-08.)*
- [ ] **The search cache is keyed on the literal query, so near-identical
      searches never reuse each other** — `agents/traversal.py:163` builds
      `search:{provider}:{query.strip().lower()}:{years}:{limit}:{fields}`, so
      the key is the raw string the user typed. "dqn" and "deep q-network"
      are different keys, and a result cached under one is invisible to the
      other even though the scout would expand both to the same searches.
      Patrick's report is exactly this shape: a paper he had already found
      didn't come back from cache on a differently-worded search for it.

      **Confirm the diagnosis before building** — it is also possible the
      entry simply expired (`config.graph.cache_ttl`, a day) or that the
      scout's expanded queries differ run to run, which would make the raw-key
      question moot. Log the key on hit/miss for a few real searches first.

      **If it is the key, the fix is a question of what to key on**, and none
      of the options are free: the scout's *expanded* queries (accurate, but
      only known after a model call — so the cache can't be checked before
      spending the thing it exists to avoid), a normalized/stemmed form of the
      raw query (cheap, catches "dqn"/"DQN " but not "deep q-network"), or an
      embedding-nearest lookup (catches paraphrase, but a nearest-neighbour
      cache can serve confidently wrong results and needs a distance
      threshold nobody has fitted). *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-08-28.)*

- [ ] **Graph build should survive S2 being down without trapping the user** —
      if Semantic Scholar is unavailable mid-build, the error message should be
      **dismissible** and the graph currently on screen restored (it must not stay
      greyed out). Frontend error handling around `fetchGraph`/`GraphExplorer`.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-08.)*
- [ ] **Replace every string `Literal` type with an `Enum`** — the backend leans
      on string `Literal[...]` unions in ~8 modules (relation types, event kinds,
      lecture modes, config choices — `agents/events.py`, `services/graph/model.py`,
      `agents/traversal.py`, `researcher/tools.py`, and others; ~30 occurrences).
      Convert **all** of them to proper `Enum`s — likely `StrEnum` so the JSON/wire
      values stay exactly the strings they are today — for one named source of
      truth, exhaustiveness, and refactor safety instead of the same literals
      retyped across modules. A whole-codebase sweep, not a targeted one; keep the
      wire format identical so snapshots, saved sessions, and the SSE protocol are
      unaffected. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-13.)*
- [ ] **Install `curious-astronaut` through the work Artifactory** — the
      publish itself is **done**: 8.3.0 went to PyPI on 2026-09-27 by trusted
      publishing from a `v*` tag (packaging v8.1.0, automation v8.2.0, the
      environment fix v8.3.0 — all in [docs/history.md](docs/history.md); the
      runbook is [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md)). **What is left is
      the check that actually closes this ticket:** `pip install
      curious-astronaut` into a clean venv **through the work-side Artifactory
      remote**. Everything before that was a rehearsal — the whole point is
      the Xray ingress, and nothing outside that network can prove it works.

      **The Xray blocker is CLEARED (2026-09-23, Patrick):** the policy does
      **not** flag *declared* optional dependencies, only what actually
      resolves. Since v7.15.0 moved `pymupdf` into the `pdf` extra, the default
      dependency graph carries no AGPL, so the PyMuPDF →
      `pypdfium2`/`pdfminer.six` swap is **not** required. Settled; don't
      re-open it.

      **The real driver, established 2026-08-09.** Not distribution to the
      public — Patrick needs the code inside his employer's network, and their
      only ingress is an **Artifactory remote that proxies PyPI** (it also
      fronts npm and other public mirrors) with a **JFrog Xray** scan on the
      way in. A public GitHub repo does *not* help if GitHub isn't an approved
      source. Artifactory serves **both sdists and wheels**, so the sdist can
      carry whatever source the work side needs — as of v8.1.0 it carries
      `frontend/src` *and* the built `frontend/dist`. The work copy is a
      **one-way import — no syncing code back** to the GitHub repo (Patrick,
      2026-08-09). **Consequences of that framing:**
      - PyPI gives no *fork* — no git history, no PRs. It seeds a work-side
        repo once; it is not a synced remote. Accepted.
      - **Answered by v8.1.0: the work side gets the frontend TypeScript
        source.** The sdist ships `frontend/src` and `frontend/public`
        alongside the built bundle, so work can either serve the prebuilt SPA
        or rebuild it through their npm mirror.
      - The **Windows CUDA torch routing does not survive publication**:
        `[[tool.uv.index]]` is uv-only resolution config, absent from wheel
        metadata, so `pip install` on Windows silently gets PyPI's CPU-only
        torch — exactly the bug that index block exists to fix. Needs at least
        a documented warning; matters less if the work side is Linux.
      Ties into the licensing work (2026-07-20) — a public, timestamped release
      is also the prior-art defense discussed there, though note
      `docs/licensing.md:61` credits *"this repo, and PyPI"*, so the repo being
      public already serves that goal on its own. **The MIT → Apache-2.0
      relicense trigger does *not* fire on a one-way import** (no outside
      copyright enters the repo); Patrick nonetheless chose to relicense first,
      2026-08-09, as a deliberate preference rather than a prerequisite.
      *(Raised 2026-07-20; re-scoped 2026-08-09 around the work-Artifactory
      driver; narrowed to the publish step 2026-09-27 when the packaging
      shipped; narrowed again to the Artifactory install 2026-10-02, once
      8.3.0 was live.)*
- [ ] **A deploy strategy** — *(this ticket had three stages; **two have
      shipped** — CI in v6.10.0 and the build-and-publish pipeline in v8.2.0.
      See [docs/history.md](docs/history.md). What follows is the remainder.)*
      Cutting a release is still hand-driven up to the tag (bump
      `pyproject.toml` → `uv lock` → merge → tag → push; see `CLAUDE.md`), but
      the tag now does the rest by itself. What was never started is deploy —
      there is no deploy story at all. Originally to
      define: a **repeatable build** (backend wheel + bundled frontend), how a
      **release** is cut and published, and **where/how the service is
      deployed**. **The first two shipped in v8.2.0**: `release.yml` now builds
      the frontend, builds and verifies the sdist + wheel, and publishes to
      TestPyPI then PyPI by trusted publishing, so a `v*` tag is the whole
      release. Packaging (distribution name, frontend bundling, installed-layout
      paths) shipped in v8.1.0 before it. **So all that remains of this ticket
      is deploy** — and it is the genuinely open one: no target has been chosen,
      and the service needs an LLM vendor (a key, or a local model beside it)
      and a writable `data/`, so it isn't a static host. *(From the `todos.md`
      inbox, 2026-07-20; narrowed 2026-08-09 when CI shipped, and again
      2026-09-27 when publishing did — leaving only deploy.)*

### Larger phases

- [ ] **Phase 5 — Knowledge network: a short course on a paper's
      prerequisites** — workshopped with Patrick 2026-10-06; replaces the old
      "Concept mindmap" phase (its *bridge* half survives as its own phase
      below). The goal, in Patrick's words: the user should **feel like they
      are taking a short course on the paper's dependencies and
      prerequisites**. Ships as two tickets, each its own minor version, in
      this order:

      **5a — Thread card home ✓, shipped in v8.13.0** — paper threads open
      on a card home (Paper Graph + Knowledge Graph cards, as since
      renamed), and the graph builds only when its card is opened. The full
      story is in [docs/history.md](docs/history.md).

      **5b — Knowledge Graph ✓, shipped in v8.14.0** — a graph of the
      *ideas* the paper rests on: the paper in gold, concepts in violet, one
      "needs" arrow, double-click to break down, a lesson per node in a
      side panel, check-offs, a course order and a 3D mode. It went through
      three shapes in review (tree → graph with paper nodes → concepts only);
      the full story is in [docs/history.md](docs/history.md).

      **Follow-ups from 5b:**
      - **Let the tutor draw on the reader's library**, not only the paper's
        references, when it writes a lesson: the researcher's
        `search_sources` already does this for answers. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-10-09.)*

      **Later stages, deliberately out of v1:**
      - **A challenger agent** that asks probe questions to learn what the
        reader knows, instead of trusting check-offs alone.
      - **Cross-paper memory of what you know.** Note this does *not* need
        user auth: `astronaut serve` is a local single-user install with
        `data/cache.db` already, so a known-concepts table there carries a
        reader's knowledge from one paper's course to the next. Auth only
        enters with a hosted deploy (see "A deploy strategy").
      - **Verified resources** — links to e.g. 3Blue1Brown's neural-network
        series. Never a URL taken straight from the model: a curated list or
        a confirmed lookup first.
      - **Interactive visuals built on the fly** — Brilliant.org-style
        explainers. **Start with generated interactive widgets** (JS/SVG with
        sliders — "drag this vector and watch *Av*") in a sandboxed iframe:
        no server render, nothing to install, and actually interactive.
        **Manim was considered and set aside** (2026-10-06): it pulls LaTeX,
        ffmpeg and cairo into an app whose core install is 83 MB, renders
        take seconds to minutes, generated scenes fail often, and it makes
        video, not interaction. If ever revived, only as an optional extra
        like `sources`/`pdf`.

      **The landscape, swept 2026-10-06** (so it isn't re-searched; and per
      "Why it exists" above, overlap is not a reason to stop):
      [SpatialRead](https://www.producthunt.com/p/spatialread/spatialread)
      builds a branching tree of expand/simplify explanations over one
      paper's text — LLM prose, no papers as nodes, no model of the reader.
      [MyLens](https://mylens.ai/ai-tree) generates expandable AI trees on any
      topic and striking illustrated, "built live" diagrams (Patrick flagged
      an electric-grid / solar power-flow example), and per Patrick appears
      to offer **MCP on its free tier** — unverified, worth a look someday,
      either as a visual source to call or as a model for exposing our own
      tools. [Manimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14306) (ICML 2025) and
      Generative Manim already turn papers/prompts into Manim video.
      [Asta](https://wiki.ubc.ca/Ai2_Asta) is search, summaries and data
      analysis. Nobody found combines **paper-grounded prerequisite nodes**,
      **a reader-shaped tree**, and **a citation graph beside it**. Patrick's
      framing: the end state may read as *MyLens + SpatialRead*, grounded in
      the literature. *(As shipped in v8.14.0 the nodes are concepts and the
      paper grounding sits in the lessons' citations, but the combination
      still holds.)*
- [ ] **Phase 6 — Slides from the lecture** — a deck built by the existing
      agent crew from lecture beats + already-mined paper figures.
      *(Renumbered from the retired audio phase, 2026-08-16. Patrick,
      2026-10-06: keep it in mind for future development.)*
- [ ] **Bridge two topics** *(unnumbered; split out of the old Phase 5,
      2026-10-06)* — cross-link two fields with no citation edge between
      them; `/api/bridge` or similar. The half of the old concept mindmap
      worth building — see the feature stack.
- ~~Phase 6 — Audio lecture (Podcastfy / Edge TTS / ElevenLabs)~~ and
  ~~Phase 7 — Polished media (AutoContent API)~~ — **retired 2026-08-16**,
  reasoning in the feature stack above. Don't re-file these from `todos.md`.

Each phase is independently shippable and gets its own version bump
(test-in-browser → bump `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` → annotated tag → push).

## Open questions & costs

- **Semantic Scholar rate limits** — real even with a key (~1 req/sec): the
  client throttles + backs off, graph snapshots cache for a day, and the
  offline citations corpus removes the deep-paging dependency entirely.
- **Citation coverage per provider** — which backend serves which seed
  honestly is measured and documented in
  [docs/citation-coverage.md](docs/citation-coverage.md) (OpenAlex
  under-extracts preprint→preprint edges; live S2 is recency-truncated; the
  corpus is S2's fix). Read it before touching citation-source logic.
- **The teacher's API cost** — since v7.13.0 there is a free path (local
  Ollama, Google's free tier), but the strongest models are still paid, and
  a small local model is the first thing to break on the researcher's
  tool-calling. Unmeasured: what a typical session actually costs on a paid
  vendor, which would at least let the README tell someone what they're
  signing up for. *(Replaced the AutoContent ~€24/mo and ElevenLabs cost
  lines, retired 2026-08-16 with those phases.)*
- **Paper figures for slides** (later phase) — largely **answered by the
  v5.28.0 figure miner**, which already pulls real figures out of open-access
  PDFs with captions; the open part is only which of ar5iv HTML vs. the arXiv
  source tarball is a better source for arXiv-native papers, and how to
  attribute them on a slide.
