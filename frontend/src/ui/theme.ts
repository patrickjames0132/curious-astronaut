 * Description:
 * The app's light/dark theme: a tiny module-level store, not a context.
 *
 * Two very different consumers need the current theme — the header's toggle
 * button and the graph canvas (which paints with JS, so it can't just read a
 * CSS variable in a stylesheet) — and they sit at opposite ends of the tree.
 * A module store with `useSyncExternalStore` gets both without threading a
 * provider through everything in between.
 *
 * The palette itself stays in CSS (`index.css`): dark is the `:root` default,
 * light is a `:root[data-theme='light']` override. This module only decides
 * *which* is active by stamping `data-theme` on the document element — so
 * adding a themed color is a stylesheet edit, not a TypeScript one.
