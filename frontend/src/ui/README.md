# `src/ui`

Small cross-cutting UI utilities with multiple consumers and no feature
home — the root-level case of the hybrid structure rule:

```
ui/
  useResizablePanel.ts — drag-to-resize for a docked panel, width
                         remembered in localStorage
  theme.ts             — the light/dark store (below)
  usePresence.ts       — keeps a closing element mounted through its exit
                         animation (below)
  Fold.tsx             — a section that opens and closes by animating its
                         height (below)
  SlidersGlyph.tsx     — the folded-controls icon, shared by the paper graph
                         and the knowledge graph (v8.14.0) so the two corner
                         buttons are one button
```

## `useResizablePanel`

Both the detail panel and the assistant panel dock on the right (border on
their left edge), so the drag handle lives on that inner-left edge:
dragging *left* widens, *right* narrows. The hook owns only the width
number + the pointer bookkeeping; the caller renders the panel with
`style={{ width }}` and drops a handle element wired to
`onHandlePointerDown`.

- **`defaultWidth` must match the panel's CSS width** so nothing shifts on
  first paint (the stored width, once one exists, wins).
- Each consumer passes its own `storageKey`, so the two panels remember
  their widths independently.
- Bounds clamp to 280–680px by default, overridable per panel — **and to 40%
  of the window** (`maxFraction`), see below.

### The width is capped by the window, the choice is not (v7.10.0)

A width in px alone is a promise the window cannot always keep. The panels
are `flex-shrink: 0`, so a panel dragged to 600px on a big monitor stayed
600px in a small window and the *canvas* gave instead — until the layout
overflowed and the page scrolled sideways (the docked chat's
sideways-scroll bug). So the ceiling is `min(max, maxFraction × innerWidth)`,
re-read on every `resize`, and `min` yields to it in a window too narrow to
honour both — a panel wider than its share of the screen is the thing being
prevented.

The reader's chosen width is stored **unclamped** and only the *rendered*
width is capped, so narrowing the window borrows width and widening it hands
the choice straight back. A drag is clamped as it moves, so the handle can
never run away from the edge you are dragging.

### A drag can also fold the panel shut — and pull it back open (v7.11.0)

The `fold` option is opt-in: keep dragging past the floor and the hook ends the
drag and calls the caller's `onToggle` instead of sitting at `min`. That is the
Azure DevOps gesture, and it matches what the drag already means — someone
hauling a panel as narrow as it goes wants the space, not the last 180px of it.

The **folded panel keeps its handle**, and dragging it back past `openAt`
unfolds it, because a collapsed edge you can't grab would make the collapse a
one-way door. Three details make the pair behave:

- Both thresholds are measured on the *unclamped* drag, so each needs
  deliberate overshoot — merely bottoming out at `min` must not fold anything.
- A folded panel measures from `collapsedWidth` (what is on screen), not from
  the width it remembers; otherwise the first unfolding drag starts a couple of
  hundred px ahead of the pointer and opens on the first pixel of movement.
- The pre-drag width is restored (and left in storage) when it folds, so
  re-opening returns the panel the reader had, not a floor-width sliver — and a
  folded panel is never *sized* by the drag, only opened.

Only the rail uses it today — the two right-docked panels close with their
own ✕.

## Who uses it

`detail/DetailPanel.tsx` and `teacher/Teacher.tsx` — the two right-docked
panels. (A second consumer is exactly why this lives at the root rather
than nested in either feature folder.)

## How it's verified

`tsc --noEmit` strict + oxlint, plus `test/ui/useResizablePanel.test.tsx` —
width seeding, drag direction, the px bounds, the pointer-up persist, the
viewport cap (including that a widened window returns the stored choice), and
both halves of the fold — bottoming out at `min` must not fold, a real
overshoot must, and the folded panel's handle must pull it back open. The feel
of a live drag stays a browser-milestone item.

## `theme.ts` — light/dark

A module-level store (not a context) behind `useSyncExternalStore`, because
its two consumers sit at opposite ends of the tree: the header's toggle
button and `graph/canvas/GraphCanvas`, which paints with JS and so can't
inherit a CSS variable from a stylesheet.

- **Dark is the default**, and deliberately *not* `prefers-color-scheme` —
  Curious Astronaut is a dark-first app, and a light OS setting shouldn't hand a
  first-time user the theme we treat as the alternative. Light is an
  explicit opt-in, remembered in `localStorage`.
- **The palette lives in CSS**, not here: dark on `:root`, light on
  `:root[data-theme='light']` (`index.css`). This module only stamps
  `data-theme`, so adding a themed color is a stylesheet edit.
- **The relation palette is intentionally theme-independent** — gold seed,
  blue references, green landmarks, pink search carry *meaning*, and read on
  either background. Only the neutrals flip.
- **The toggle's icon shows the action, not the state**: ☀ while dark
  (click for light), ☾ while light. A single toggle button labelled with its
  current state is the one people click twice; the `title`/`aria-label`
  spells it out either way.


## `useResizablePanel` docks either way (v7.8.0)

It was written for right-docked panels (the detail panel, the assistant), where
dragging the inner-left handle *leftward* widens. The left rail is the exact
mirror, so the hook gained a `side` option rather than a twin: it flips the
sign of the drag and nothing else. Both directions keep the same feel — the
pointer moves *away* from the panel's own edge to widen it, which is the only
property that has to hold.

## `usePresence` — exits, not just entrances (v8.8.0)

React removes an element the moment its `open` flag goes false, so anything
could animate *in* but nothing could animate *out*. `usePresence(open)`
splits "open" from "present": when `open` drops, the element stays mounted
with `closing` set, its stylesheet plays an exit keyframe off a `.closing`
class, and the element's own `animationend` unmounts it. Reopening mid-exit
clears `closing`, so the entrance replays.

- **Exits are their own keyframes** (`pop-out`, `find-fold` — in `index.css`
  and `graph/graph.css`), never the entrance with `animation-direction:
  reverse`: an animation only restarts when its *name* changes, so a flipped
  direction would not replay anything.
- **Only the element's own `animationend` counts** — the event bubbles, and a
  child's fade finishing first must not cut the parent's exit short.
- **Nothing lingers as a ghost.** Where no exit can play — reduced motion, or
  no animation engine at all (jsdom) — it unmounts at once; a 600ms fallback
  timeout catches any missed event. A `.closing` element sets
  `pointer-events: none`, and the click-away scrims render only while open,
  so the exit never swallows the reader's next click.
- **Content must survive the exit.** The `@` list's hook clears its results
  in the same render that closes it, so `Teacher` hands the panel the last
  list that was actually on screen while it fades.

Users: the filters popover (`search/SearchControls`), the source-scope picker
(`teacher/ScopePicker`), both rail menus (`shell/SessionRow`, the collapsed
data-source menu in `shell/SideBar`), the `@` suggestions (`teacher/Teacher` →
`mentions/MentionSuggestions`), the graph's find bar
(`graph/controls/FindBar`), and — since v8.9.0 — the two docked panels: the
detail panel (`graph/GraphExplorer` holds the last paper while it slides out)
and the assistant (`teacher/Teacher`, which never unmounts: there the hook
only delays `.collapsed` until the slide-out has played). Verified by `test/ui/usePresence.test.tsx`, which
stubs an animation engine into jsdom to exercise the exit path.

## `Fold` — sections that open to their real height (v8.10.0)

`height: auto` can't be animated, so `<Fold open>` uses the one-cell grid:
the wrapper is `display: grid` and its single row animates between `0fr` and
`1fr` — a fraction of the content's own height — while `.fold-inner` clips
(`fold-open` / `fold-close` in `index.css`). It only clips *while moving*, so
anything in an open section that overflows (a tooltip, a focus ring) isn't
cut off at rest.

- **Only a change animates.** A fold that mounts already open just appears.
  Without that, a restored conversation would unfold every trace at once.
- **Closed means unmounted, or `keepMounted`.** The default unmounts the
  content after the close plays (via `usePresence`); `keepMounted` keeps it
  behind `hidden`, for content that is costly to rebuild — a lecture's beats
  hold their loaded figures.

Users: the trace steps and lecture beats in a chat turn
(`teacher/transcript/ChatMessage`) and the folding groups in Settings
(`settings/SettingsModal`). (The graph controls used it briefly, and moved
to a fade-into-a-button instead — see `graph/controls/README.md`.) Verified by
`test/ui/Fold.test.tsx`.
