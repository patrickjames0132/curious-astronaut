 * Description:
 * The transcript slice: the reader's conversations — their turns, lectures
 * included — **several at once**, keyed by exploration.
 *
 * This slice is why the old `onStateChange`/`teacherStateRef` plumbing died:
 * the transcript used to live in Teacher.tsx with a live duplicate hoisted
 * into Curious Astronaut purely so Save could read it. Now there is exactly one copy,
 * owned by neither component.
 *
 * **Why it holds more than one conversation.** Until v7.16.0 it held exactly
 * one, and switching exploration therefore had to *abort* whatever was
 * streaming — otherwise the running answer would have carried on writing into
 * the conversation you had just moved to. That made switching mid-answer
 * destroy the answer. Conversations are now keyed, so a stream writes into the
 * exploration that started it whether or not that one is on screen, and you
 * can leave an answer running and come back to it.
 *
 * **How a stream addresses its own conversation.** Every action takes an
 * optional key as its *second* argument, carried in `meta.key`; omitted, it
 * targets whichever conversation is active. That default is deliberate — the
 * many dispatches that are plainly about what the reader is looking at
 * (clearing the chat, spotlighting a citation) stay unchanged and unkeyed,
 * while the streaming paths capture their key once at stream start and pass it
 * every time. Only code that can outlive the switch has to think about it.
