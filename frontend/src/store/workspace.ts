 * canvas renders, the teacher grounds in, and Save serializes.
 *
 * Serializability rule: this slice holds the RAW GraphResponse and discovery
 * arrays (plain JSON). The mutable sim dataset (`Base`) is derived FROM this
 * state canvas-side and never enters the store — react-force-graph mutates
 * its objects, the exact opposite of what Redux state may be.
