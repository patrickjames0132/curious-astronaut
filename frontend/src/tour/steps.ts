 * Description:
 * The tour step lists: data only — the walking/spotlighting lives in
 * `Tour.tsx`; the `data-tour` attributes these selectors point at are planted
 * where each control renders (`search/Search.tsx`,
 * `graph/controls/GraphControls.tsx`, `detail/DetailPanel.tsx`,
 * `teacher/Teacher.tsx`).
 *
 * Two phases, because the app has two first-times: {@link HOME_TOUR} covers
 * the search surface and auto-runs on first launch, before any graph exists;
 * {@link GRAPH_TOUR} covers the graph tools and auto-runs on the first graph.
 * `App.tsx` picks the list (and the seen-flag) by whether a graph is up.
 * A third list, {@link SETTINGS_TOUR}, belongs to the settings modal, which
 * mounts it itself (the ? beside its ✕): its steps *stage* the section or
 * sub-page they point at, so the walk drives the modal's own nav.
 * Within a list, steps whose control isn't on screen skip themselves (the
 * year/citation sliders only render when the graph spans a range, the detail
 * panel needs a selected paper, the ask bar needs the assistant open),
 * so each list describes its phase's *maximal* tour.

/**
 * The graph-tools tour, following the eye's path across the screen
 * (re-sequenced with Patrick, v5.22.0): the top-left controls panel walked
 * top-to-bottom through its last row ("Open a paper"), then the
 * bottom-right find control, then the detail panel (a whole-panel overview
 * stop, then its sections), then the teacher — the source scope under the ask
 * bar, then the bar itself, which carries two stops: what the researcher does
 * with a question, and how asking for a lecture reaches the other assistant.
 * The walk follows the eye down the panel and ends where the reader types.
 *
 * It used to open on a lecture grid at the top of the panel. That grid became
 * one button in v7.17.0, was folded behind a caret in v7.10.0, became a
 * `/lecture` command in v7.21.0 — which also deleted the panel's folding
 * sections entirely, so every teacher stop now hangs off the composer — and
 * became plain words in v7.23.0, when the command went.
 * (Find used to open the tour — a leftover from its top-right era; starting on
 * a tiny corner button read as a diagonal jump.)
 * The steps inside the controls panel stage `'controls'` so a
 * collapsed panel expands under the walk; the year/citation stops carry their
 * own target as `presentIf` — an existence check, which the collapsed panel's
 * `hidden` (still-in-DOM) body passes whenever the graph's data earns those
 * sliders at all. `'assistant'` does a narrower job for the teacher: it opens
 * the panel, and that is all it has to do now that nothing in there folds.
