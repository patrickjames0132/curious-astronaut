 * Description:
 * A reusable, data-driven coach-mark tour: dims the screen, spotlights one
 * target element at a time, and anchors an explainer bubble beside it, with
 * Back / Next, a step counter, a title that doubles as a jump-to-any-stop
 * select, a Skip link, and a ✕ — the Yotpo-style product tour. Purely
 * presentational over a `steps` array; the caller owns when it mounts
 * (mounting starts the tour) and what "seen" means (`onClose`).
 *
 * Steps whose target selector matches nothing — or matches an element that is
 * currently hidden — are skipped, so one step list can describe optional UI
 * (a slider that only renders on multi-year graphs, a panel that may be
 * collapsed) without the tour ever pointing at a blank spot.
 *
 * **It renders into `document.body`** (a portal), wherever it is mounted.
 * Its spotlight and bubble are `position: fixed` and placed from viewport
 * rects, which only holds while no ancestor is a containing block for fixed
 * descendants. The settings modal mounts its tour inside itself, and its
 * `modal-in` entrance animates `transform` with fill `both` (v8.11.0), which
 * makes the modal exactly such an ancestor: the spotlight landed offset by
 * the modal's own position and missed every target (fixed in v8.16.0).
