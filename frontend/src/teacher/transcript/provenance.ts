 * Description:
 * Turn an answer's observed provenance counts into the one line the
 * transcript shows under it — what the answer drew on, or the plain
 * admission that nothing grounded it.
 *
 * The backend ships facts rather than a verdict (it watched the searches
 * happen and counted the citations; it does not label them), so the wording
 * lives here, where it can change without touching the agent. The rule it
 * encodes: say what the answer *drew on*, and never imply grounding that
 * isn't there. Curious Astronaut grounds answers; when it can't, the honest thing is to
 * say so and let the student take the question elsewhere.
