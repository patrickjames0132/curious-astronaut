 * Description:
 * The unified assistant — a slim shell around one conversation, rendered in
 * two shapes and at two capability levels. The shapes:
 *   • `landing` — no graph yet, so the chat owns the whole body as a centred
 *     column. This is the app's front door, and needs neither a graph nor an
 *     uploaded library to be useful.
 *   • docked — a graph is open, so it collapses to a resizable side panel
 *     beside the map.
 * The capability, independently:
 *   • No graph → the researcher, seedless: the literature plus whatever
 *     sources the reader has uploaded.
 *   • A graph is open → the streaming lecture + agentic Q&A over it.
 *
 * **The two shapes are one component instance, deliberately.** The shell keeps
 * it at a single position in the tree and only swaps the `landing` flag, so
 * entering graph mode collapses the chat into the panel without remounting —
 * the conversation, its scroll position and its run state all survive. That
 * is the whole point of clicking a cited paper: the answer you were reading is
 * still there when its graph arrives. (`epoch`, which the parent keys on, no
 * longer bumps on a graph load for the same reason — only Home and a session
 * restore remount.)
 *
 * **Docked, the panel is a stack of folding sections** (v7.10.0): *Lectures*
 * — the four mode buttons and whichever lecture is shown — and *Chat*, the
 * conversation, whose caret row also carries every control that binds the ask:
 * the 🎓/📚 scope pickers and the 🔍/▽ search controls, because those scope
 * the researcher answering there rather than the lecturer above.
 * Before this the two shared one scroll and took turns: playing a lecture hid
 * the chat, asking a question hid the lecture. Sections let a reader keep a
 * lecture open and ask about it. With no graph there is nothing to divide, so
 * the conversation simply is the panel.
 *
 * **The ask bar itself holds nothing but the question** (v7.11.0). Those four
 * controls all used to sit inside the pill, which made the one thing you came
 * here to use — a box to type in — read as a toolbar with a text field wedged
 * in it. Without a graph they moved out to a chip row directly beneath the
 * bar; with one, up to the Chat row above it. Either way they stay adjacent to
 * the ask they modify, and the bar goes back to looking like a bar.
 *
 * The conversation itself lives in the store (transcript slice) and the
 * stream orchestration in useConversation; this component owns only what it
 * alone renders — the input box, the section folds, the scope picker's data,
 * the lightbox. A restored session's transcript arrives via the store, no
 * seeding props needed.
