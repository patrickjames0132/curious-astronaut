 * Description:
 * The conversation engine: drives the agent streams and dispatches their
 * events into the store (transcript, highlights, discoveries), while owning
 * the panel-local run state — the active beat/answer, the stream error, the
 * abort controllers (one for the message in flight, one for the classify in
 * front of it), and the backend session id.
 *
 * It used to own a second, parallel engine: a lecture had its own controller,
 * its own store slot, and a show/hide/clear/regenerate lifecycle around it,
 * because a lecture came from a button rather than from a message. Since
 * v7.21.0 every lecture arrives the way every answer does — as a reply to
 * something typed — so there is one stream path, not two.
 *
 * The split of responsibilities is the Phase 6 state directive: everything
 * the canvas or Save needs goes through the store; everything only this
 * panel renders stays right here.

   * Deliver a lecture as the answer to a typed message.

   * to it, ask a follow-up underneath it, and keep the one before it. It runs
   * on the same `askCtrl` as {@link ask} for the same reason — one message is
   * in flight at a time, whichever assistant is answering it.
   *
   * There was a second path until v7.21.0: a `runLecture` writing into the
   * panel's own `lecture` slot on its own controller, so a button lecture and
   * a chat answer streamed in parallel. This is what is left of the two.
   *
   * @param question The message as typed, which becomes the user turn.
   * @param framing  How to tell it — from the router, or a correction.
   * @param routed   Whether a model chose this destination. True marks the
   *                 turn so the transcript can offer the researcher instead;
   *                 false is a choice the reader made themselves, which needs
   *                 no second-guessing.
   * @param scope    The turn's scope, resolved once by `send` (or by a
   *                 correction re-resolving a stamped request). Omitted, the
   *                 default scope from the store — the selection, else what

   * plain facts. Everything above it — a pasted id, a bare `@`-mention, an
   * unresolved `@phrase` — is decided by a regex or by what the reader picked
   * from a dropdown; this one asks a model, because the difference between

   *
   * **The classify is skipped whenever there is no graph.** With no second
   * destination to choose and no papers a message could name, paying for
   * the choice would be spending the reader's latency on a foregone
   * conclusion.
   *
   * **The turn's scope is resolved here, once, for whichever agent answers.**
   * The route says what the message asked for — `screen` when it didn't
   * say, still the common case; "the references", "the seed", named papers
   * (one more call to resolve them against the graph), a period — and
   * `resolveScope` applies the priority list: message, else the hand-picked
   * selection, else what passes the filters. A message scope **becomes the
   * selection** (`nodeSelectionSet`: ringed, drawn even where a filter would
   * hide it) and stays after the turn, like a pick made by hand — a request
   * that changes the scope changes it, it does not borrow it (Patrick,
   * 2026-09-15). A message scope that matches nothing fails the turn in
   * words rather than falling through to the next rung: the reader asked
   * for papers, and silence about not finding them would be the app
   * deciding it knew better — and the selection is left as it was.
