# `src` — the Curious Astronaut frontend

React + TypeScript (strict) + Vite. State follows one rule: **a component's
state lives where the component lives; only genuinely cross-cutting state
goes to the Redux store** (`store/` — five slices: explorations, workspace, transcript,
highlight, library). Structure follows the hybrid rule: feature folders at the root
for anything with multiple consumers or render sites; single-parent
components nest inside their parent's folder (e.g. `teacher/transcript/`).

```

`figures/Lightbox.tsx` is the frontend's first true multi-consumer, root-level
component (promoted from `teacher/figures/` once the detail panel became a
second caller) — see "the hybrid rule" above.

Non-visual folders: `api/` (the typed backend client — the only layer that
knows URLs and SSE frames), `store/` (the five slices + typed hooks),
`notation/` (the cross-cutting math renderer — `<MathText>` for the DOM
surfaces, `latexToUnicode` for canvas node labels), `graph/hooks/` +
`graph/model.ts`/`theme.ts` (the sim machinery), `ui/` (cross-cutting UI
utilities — `useResizablePanel` for both right-docked panels),
`mentions/` (the chat bar's `@` lookup for papers and sibling threads — its
grammar, typeahead and dropdown), `scope/` (which papers a turn is about — the message → selection →
visible priority list both agents share), `search/useDirectSearch.ts`,
`shell/useSessions.ts`, `detail/useSelection.ts`,
`teacher/useConversation.ts` (each feature's state/logic hooks).

(`commands/` sat here from v7.21.0 to v7.23.0 — the `/lecture` command's
grammar and menu. It went when the router learned to read a lecture's scope
off the words, which a two-value command could never express; its shape —
`mentions/` minus the network half — is in `docs/history.md` if a command
system is ever wanted again.)

Every folder has its own README with the full story — this file is just the
map. Verified by `npm run build` (strict tsc + Vite) and oxlint; behavior
by the end-of-phase browser milestone.

One oxlint rule is worth calling out because it encodes a house convention
rather than a correctness check: **`id-length`** (`min: 2`) is the frontend
half of CLAUDE.md's no-single-letter-identifiers rule — the backend half is
`check_identifiers.py`. It runs over `src/` and `test/` alike. Two
deliberate settings:

- **`properties: "never"`** — object-literal keys and member access are
  exempt, because those names are usually not ours: react-force-graph's
  `node.x`/`.y`, a `VLink`'s `_s`/`_t`, react-markdown's `a:` component
  override, `latexToUnicode`'s subscript map keyed by the LaTeX character
  itself. The cost is that a destructured `const { a } = obj` slips
  through — an accepted trade for not drowning in false positives.
- **`exceptions: ["_"]`** — the pure-discard idiom, `.map((_, index) => …)`.

TypeScript property *signatures* are still checked (they're declarations, not
accesses), so the handful of genuinely external field names declared in our
own types carry a scoped `oxlint-disable` with a comment saying whose name it
is — see `graph/model.ts` (`x`/`y`) and `api/search.ts` (the `q` wire key).

Thread navigation remounts the canvas and chat with distinct sibling keys
(`graph:<epoch>` and `teacher:<epoch>`). The shell regression test cycles
between General and two graphs and checks that only one explorer and one
chat panel remain mounted. General renders no explorer.
