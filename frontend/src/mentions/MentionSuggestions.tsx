 * Description:
 * The `@`-mention dropdown: the sibling threads and paper candidates for what
 * is being typed, shown above the composer.
 *
 * Above rather than below because the composer sits at the bottom of the panel
 * and a list below it would open off-screen. Two sections, threads first: the
 * reader's other discussions in this exploration, then the paper results. A
 * paper row is the **title** over `authors • venue • year` — the venue earns
 * its place here specifically, since two papers with near-identical titles
 * have to be told apart before one is picked, and where it was published is
 * what does that.
 *
 * No row is highlighted until the reader arrows onto or hovers one, and the
 * footer says what Enter will do *right now*: with nothing chosen it sends the
 * message as typed; on a paper that is the whole message it opens that paper;
 * on a paper inside a sentence it completes the title; on a thread it attaches
 * the discussion. The hint changes with the state because the two jobs Enter
 * has — send what I typed, take what I chose — are told apart only by whether
 * a row is lit, and a reader should not have to remember that rule.
