 * Description:
 * The graph exploration area: the canvas, its controls, the legend, and the
 * detail panel (plus its figure lightbox) — plus every piece of state only
 * they read (the `base` sim dataset, declutter filters, hover, selection,
 * canvas size).
 *
 * Store boundary (the Phase 6 state directive, drawn precisely here):
 *   READS  workspace.graph (to build `base`), workspace discoveries (merged
 *          into the sim in place as they arrive), workspace.layout, and the
 *          highlight ids the teacher lights up.
 *   OWNS   everything mutable/sim-side — `base` keeps object identity for a
 *          graph's whole life; react-force-graph mutates its objects, which
 *          is exactly why none of this may live in Redux.
 *
 * `children` renders inside the canvas wrap — the shell drops its overlays
 * (hit list, loading/error/hint) there without this component knowing them.
