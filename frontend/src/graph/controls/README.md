# `src/graph/controls`

The DOM chrome over the canvas — the declutter panel and the color legend.
Two components, nested here per the hybrid structure rule: their only
parent is `graph/GraphExplorer.tsx`.

```
controls/
  GraphControls.tsx — a panel that folds away into a sliders button, over:
                      layout toggle,
                      per-relation filter chips, the dual-knob year slider,
                      the citation-count threshold slider, the count
                      readout + release/fit/refresh/clear action row, the
                      node-selector gesture hint, the per-layout hint line
  Legend.tsx        — the color legend (agent entries appear on first use)
```

Both are purely presentational (the Phase 6 state directive): every set,
count, and id arrives as a prop from `GraphExplorer`; every interaction
fires a callback upward. Both read `../theme.ts` (`REL_COLOR` /
`REL_LABEL` / `REL_TYPES`) so the chrome can never disagree with the
canvas about what "a reference" looks like, and both style via
`../graph.css`.

## `GraphControls` — points worth knowing

- **The whole panel folds away into a sliders button — and starts there.**
  Since v8.10.0, collapsed is a square sliders button in the panel’s corner
  (`.ctrl-icon`, the find bar's 🔍 pattern), not a slim header strip: the
  "Graph controls" header folds the panel (it fades out toward its corner,
  `pop-out`, via `ui/usePresence`) and the button pops in; the button opens it
  again. The strip went because it cost a row of canvas for a paper count,
  and because collapsing it switched the panel to `width: auto` while the
  body was still folding — for a few frames auto meant the widest unwrapped
  row, and the panel ballooned before it closed. Nothing changes width now.
  The count readout lives in the open panel's footer only. Only the visible
  control carries `data-tour="controls-head"`, so the tour's first stop never
  lands on a hidden header. The collapsed flag
  is the panel's one piece of local state (like FindBar's own open/closed),
  and since **v7.9.0 it starts `true`**: a freshly built graph opens onto the
  *graph*, not onto its own chrome, and the reader who wants to declutter
  opens the panel by its header (the same change stopped the detail panel
  auto-opening — see `detail/README.md`). That's the initial value only —
  re-seeding while the explorer is up leaves the panel however the reader
  left it, because expanding it was a choice and a re-seed is no reason to
  undo it.
  The panel hides via `hidden`, **not** unmounting — the guided tour judges
  its year/citation stops by element *existence* (`presentIf`), and those
  targets must survive a collapse. The panel steps stage `'controls'`
  (`tour/steps.ts` → `Curious Astronaut` → `GraphExplorer`'s `tourStage` → the
  `stagedOpen` prop), which re-expands a collapsed panel so the walk has
  something to spotlight; it never re-collapses after (no tidy-up, same as
  the detail panel's staged seed selection).
- **The chips are the only node-type filter, and the seed has one** (v7.17.0).
  Each toggles one kind of node on/off; a hidden relation's edges drop, and
  neighbors reachable only through them fall out of the view. They are driven
  by **`CHIP_TYPES`** — `REL_TYPES` plus `'seed'` — deliberately a different
  list from `REL_TYPES` itself, because that one is the set of *relations a
  neighbour can have*: `primaryRel` handles the seed before consulting it and
  the per-relation rank maps exclude it, so adding `'seed'` there would have
  quietly changed both. The seed earned a chip because a lecture now narrates
  exactly what is on screen, and without one the seed was the single paper a
  reader could not scope out — "summarize these five citers" always came out as
  six papers. It stays exempt from the *year* and *citation* sliders, which trim
  a population of neighbours the seed isn't part of. Labels are
  (Seed paper / References / Citations) — the two citer pools became one `citation`
  relation in v7.17.0, so there is no Latest Publications chip; `similar` was
  retired
  from the seed graph in v5.0.0, so there's no Similar chip; `search`- and
  `similar`-tagged papers (both only from the researcher) have no chip and stay
  visible. (The old per-relation count sliders were retired too — the backend
  already citation-budgets each pool, so a second per-relation cap was redundant
  chrome.)
- **The citation-count slider is a dual-knob window, not a fetch.** Like the
  year range — and bounded the same way, by the graph's actual min…max
  citation counts so neither knob has dead travel — two thumbs bound a
  citation window over the already-budgeted pool. The thumbs ride a **log
  scale** (see `model.ts` `citationThreshold`) because citation counts fan out
  over orders of magnitude, and their positions map to the displayed counts.
  Full-open (min…max) shows everything; it only renders when the neighbors
  span a citation range to filter against. Reuses the `.range-dual`
  track/fill/thumb CSS.
- **The find control** (`FindBar.tsx` — a round 🔍 button pinned bottom-right
  of the graph area, mirroring the legend, expanding into a rounded input
  pill on click) spotlights on-screen papers by title/author substring —
  purely lexical and local, no API call; the header's seed search is the
  one that fetches. It started life inside this panel (crowded), then as an
  always-open pill (read as floating in no-man's land over the Timeline
  axis), then collapse-until-wanted pinned top-right, before moving to the
  bottom-right corner (the fallback agreed when top-right shipped).
  A live query pins the pill open; clearing (✕, Esc, blur while empty)
  tucks it back to the 🔍. When there are hits, a **"select" link — or
  Enter in the box — commits the whole match set to the teacher's
  hand-picked scope** in one press (both affordances on purpose: the link
  is discoverable, Enter is fast) — additive via `nodeSelectionAdded`,
  exactly like the marquee — and GraphExplorer clears the find so the
  cyan selection (not the find spotlight) shows the result: find →
  select → ask in three gestures.
  Matching lives in `model.findMatches` over the
  *visible* view (a filtered-out paper can't match invisibly);
  GraphExplorer owns the query state and routes the matches through the
  same highlight machinery the teacher's glow uses (matches glow + label,
  everything else dims; zero hits dims the whole graph — honest feedback).
  A new graph resets it; the graph-wide Esc/clear-all drops it too.
- **The year slider only renders when the graph spans more than one
  year** — a single-year graph gets nothing to filter. Its two knobs clamp
  against each other (`lo ≤ hi`).
- **One count readout, shared by the footer and the collapsed bar.** The
  same string renders in both places: `N / total papers shown` under bare
  filters, flipping to `N papers selected` while a hand-pick exists. It read
  `N / shown papers selected` until v7.24.0, when the pick scoped the teacher
  as `selected ∩ visible`; the selection outranks the filters now
  (`scope/README.md`), so a denominator of shown papers would be a lie the
  moment a slider hid a selected one. The old `N picked · clear` status row
  under the gesture hint retired in favor of this flip.
- **The node-selector row teaches the marquee gestures.** An always-on hint
  line (`alt-drag to pick nodes for the teacher · shift-click to add/remove`)
  makes the modifier-drag discoverable — the gesture itself lives in
  `hooks/useMarquee.ts`. Clearing the pick moved into the action row: the
  **Clear** button (disabled until a pick or a teacher highlight exists — and
  **Esc**, same reset, see `hooks/useEscapeClear.ts`) drops *everything* lit
  at once: the pick and the teacher's glow, wherever it came from.
- **The hint line teaches per-layout gestures** — drag-to-pin in Force,
  left→right-by-year in Timeline; double-click-to-reseed in both.
- **Release** unpins every node AND reheats the simulation — it stays enabled
  with nothing pinned, because "re-settle a drifted force layout" is a want of
  its own (it used to require abusing a filter chip's reheat side effect).
  Timeline keeps its date columns through a release; only heights re-relax.
  The camera stays put: releasing no longer re-arms the one-shot zoomToFit
  latch, so the graph re-settles under the user's current zoom (Patrick's
  call — the yank out to fit-everything read as losing your place).
- **Refresh** busts the seed's day-cached snapshot server-side; the button
  disables while a load is in flight.
- **The `providerNote` line** surfaces a provider-specific caveat under the
  controls when one applies — currently the Semantic Scholar ~10k citer-offset
  limit (the most-cited citers come from the recent citer tip, not the full
  history).
  `GraphExplorer` passes the string (or `null`) based on the active provider.

## `Legend` — never explain marks that aren't on screen

The three relation entries (Seed / References / Citations) are static; one entry is conditional — "Discovered by teacher"
(dashed ring) appears only once the agent has actually pulled a paper in
mid-conversation, from the workspace slice's `selectHasDiscovered` via
`GraphExplorer`. A "Found by search" (pink) entry sat beside it until v7.5.0,
when the `search` and `similar` relations were removed outright; the legend
lists what the graph can contain, and neither can arrive any more.

## How it's verified

`tsc --noEmit` strict + oxlint; slider/chip/legend behavior is a standing
item of the end-of-phase browser milestone.
