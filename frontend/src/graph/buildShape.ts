 * Description:
 * The build shape — how much of a seed's neighborhood the backend ships.
 *
 * A module-level store behind `useSyncExternalStore`, the same shape as
 * `ui/theme.ts` and for the same reason: its consumers sit at opposite ends of
 * the tree (the settings modal writes it, the graph controls read it to decide
 * whether the count sliders exist, and `loadGraph` reads it *outside* React
 * entirely to put it on the request).
 *
 * **Why this isn't a config setting.** Every other knob in the app lives in
 * `config.json`. This one belongs to the person exploring, not to the
 * deployment, and it changes between one build and the next — so it's carried
 * by the browser and sent per request. The v6.0.0 purge deleted the old file
 * toggles for exactly this reason; this deliberately does not bring them back.
 *
 * **Why it isn't a Redux slice either.** The workspace slice holds `provider`,
 * which is the closest analogue — but `provider` is part of a *saved session*,
 * and the shape isn't: reopening a saved graph should rebuild it the way *you*
 * currently size graphs, not the way whoever saved it did. localStorage, like
 * the theme, is the honest home for that.
 *
 * `adaptive` is the headline. ON (the default) means the app sizes itself and
 * the other three fields are inert — the backend ignores them, and the controls
 * hide the per-chip count sliders. OFF hands sizing to the user.
