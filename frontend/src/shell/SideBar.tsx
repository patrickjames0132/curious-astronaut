 * Description:
 * The app's left rail: what the header used to be, turned on its side and
 * made collapsible — the shape ChatGPT and Claude both settled on, and for
 * the same reason. A top bar spends the scarcest axis (vertical) on chrome
 * that is mostly idle, while a rail spends the plentiful one and can be
 * folded away entirely when the map wants the room.
 *
 * It holds three bands:
 *   • **top** — the collapse toggle, and "New graph", which clears the
 *     workspace back to the landing chat;
 *   • **middle** — the saved sessions, listed like a chat history, each with
 *     a ⋮ menu for rename/delete. This is the band that made the rail worth
 *     building: saved graphs used to hide behind a drawer button, and a
 *     thing you accumulate should be visible;
 *   • **bottom** — Library, Settings, theme, tour.
 *
 * Collapsed it becomes an icon rail. Every entry keeps the glyph it already
 * had in the header (📚 🗂 ⚙ ☀/☾ ?), so folding the rail hides words rather
 * than changing vocabulary.

/**
 * The data source, as a rail entry in either state.
 *
 * **Expanded** it is a native `<select>` dressed as a rail row: the cylinder
 * in the glyph lane, the chosen backend's name on the label column, a caret
 * at the far end, and the browser's own list on click. It lines up with
 * Library and Settings beneath it — the bordered box it was until v7.31.0
 * had its own left edge and its own text column, the one thing on the rail
 * that lined up with nothing. The row shows the *choice* rather than the
 * word "Data source" because a native select can only display its selected
 * option; the heading is the tooltip's job. (A custom popup was tried first:
 * beside the rail it sat a whole rail-width from its entry, and above the
 * entry it looked like a second control. The browser's list is anchored
 * where readers expect a select's to be.)
 *
 * **Collapsed** there is no width to show a value in, so the cylinder stands
 * alone and the choice moves into a popup opening to the right of the rail.
 * **One click there selects and closes** — unlike the chat bar's source
 * picker, which is a multi-select and has to stay open while you tick
 * things. This is one-of-two, so a menu that lingered after the choice would
 * just be a second click to dismiss.
 *
 * @param provider The selected backend.
 * @param onChange Commit a new backend.
 * @param disabled A build is in flight, so switching is refused.
 * @param labelled The rail is expanded, so the entry shows its value.
 * @returns The rail entry and, collapsed and open, its menu.
