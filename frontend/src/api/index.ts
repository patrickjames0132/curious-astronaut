 * Description:
 * Typed client for the Curious Astronaut backend API.
 *
 * Split by concern into sibling modules; this barrel re-exports them so callers
 * keep importing everything from `./api`:
 *   search   — live (S2) + local seed search, and the field-picker vocabulary
 *   graph    — the paper neighborhood graph, detail hydration, figures
 *   agents   — streaming lecture, Q&A, and offline library chat (SSE)
 *   sources  — the user's local semantic library (bring-your-own sources)
 *   mentions — the composer's `@` paper lookup
 *   sessions — saved workspaces (graph + transcript)
 *   settings — the settings modal's config-file read/write
 *   sse      — the shared text/event-stream reader (internal)
