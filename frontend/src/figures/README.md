# `src/figures`

The full-screen figure lightbox — click anywhere (or the ✕, or Escape) to
close.

```
figures/
  Lightbox.tsx
```

## Why it's here, not nested in a feature folder

This is the frontend's first true multi-consumer component, so it lives at
the root per the hybrid structure rule (`src/README.md`): a component with
more than one render site gets its own folder; a single-parent one nests
inside whichever feature owns it.

It started in `teacher/figures/` (built for the agent's cited answer
figures — `AnswerFigure`s always carry a `figure` number and an `index`).
Once the detail panel's own paper figures (`detail/DetailPanel.tsx`) became
a second, unrelated caller, it was promoted here rather than either feature
importing from the other's folder — teacher's `FigCard.tsx` stayed put
(still teacher-only chat-bubble styling), only the shared lightbox moved.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **One prop shape serves two very different callers.** `AnswerFigure`
  (`api/agents.ts`) has only `image`/`caption`/`title` required — `figure`,
  `index`, and `slot` are optional because the detail panel's paper figures
  have none of them (they're just a list in DOM order, not individually
  numbered/cited the way an agent's `show_figure` attachment is). The
  caption line renders `Figure N` only when `figure` is a number, and joins
  whatever combination of that/`title`/`caption` is actually present rather
  than assuming all three — an easy trap now that a second caller can leave
  most of them unset.
- **The detail panel passes `title: null`.** Showing the paper's own title
  in its own lightbox would be redundant — you're already looking at its
  detail panel. The teacher's answer figures need it (they can be for *any*
  cited paper, not just the one you're looking at).
- **Each caller owns its own lightbox state.** `Teacher.tsx` and
  `graph/GraphExplorer.tsx` each hold their own `useState<AnswerFigure |
  null>` and render their own `<Lightbox>` instance. Simpler than threading
  one shared instance through two unrelated component trees for a feature
  that's never open from both places at once anyway.
- **It is always rendered, and takes `null` when closed (v8.10.0).** That
  lets it fade out: `ui/usePresence` holds it mounted through the exit, and
  it keeps the last figure it showed, because the caller has already set its
  state to null by then. The Escape listener is attached only while a figure
  is open.

## Who uses it, and how/why

- **`teacher/Teacher.tsx`** — enlarges a cited paper's figure, attached via
  the researcher's `show_figure` tool and rendered inline in the chat
  (`teacher/figures/FigCard.tsx`'s click handler).
- **`graph/GraphExplorer.tsx`** — enlarges one of the selected paper's own
  figures (ar5iv), rendered in `detail/DetailPanel.tsx`.

## How it's verified

`tsc --noEmit` strict + oxlint; click-to-enlarge and Escape-to-close are
browser-milestone items.
