 *
 * Description:
 * The settings modal — a config-file editor in the style of Claude Desktop's
 * settings: a left sidebar (search + grouped nav) and a right content pane of
 * label-left / control-right rows.
 *
 * Rows are **data** (`ROW_DEFS`): each carries its section, an optional group
 * heading, label + hint text, and a control renderer. That one registry
 * drives rendering *and* the PyCharm-style search — typing filters the nav to
 * sections with a matching row and the pane to the matching rows themselves.
 *
 * The modal loads the active config file on open, edits a local draft, and
 * writes the whole draft back on Save — the server validates before writing
 * anything, applies accepted writes to the running app live, and returns the
 * exact field error on a rejection (shown red in the footer). General's
 * config-file row is the one hand-rendered control (a path field plus a 📁
 * button that opens the OS file chooser via the backend — a browser's own
 * picker never reveals absolute paths); a missing default config.json is
 * auto-created from the example server-side.
 *
 * The modal carries its own guided tour (`SETTINGS_TOUR`, the ? beside the
 * ✕): the same coach-mark engine as the app's tour, with steps that *stage*
 * the section or sub-page they spotlight, so the walk moves through the nav
 * on the reader's behalf.
 *
