 * Description:
 * Curious Astronaut — the shell. Composes the header, the drawers, and the body; owns only
 * what it alone renders: drawer visibility, the seed-search instance (its
 * three render sites — the header form, the hit-list overlay, the submit
 * routing — all live here), and the loading/error overlays.
 *
 * **The body has two states, and the seam matters.** With no graph the
 * assistant is the landing surface (a centred chat, the app's front door) and
 * the overlays get their own layer over the body; with a graph it's the
 * explorer, and the assistant docks beside it. The `Teacher` element stays at
 * one position in the tree across both. Thread navigation remounts the
 * graph and chat with distinct keys; their durable state lives in the store.
 *
 * Everything cross-cutting lives in the store (see `store/README.md`):
 * the workspace (graph + discoveries + layout), the transcript, and the
 * highlight ids. The old shell's transcript-duplicating refs and remount
 * plumbing died with that move — Save reads the store, not a hoisted copy.
