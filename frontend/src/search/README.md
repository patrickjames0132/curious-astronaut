# `src/search`

Finding a seed paper — **from the chat bar**, since v7.6.0. This folder no
longer owns a search *surface*; it owns the two small controls that arm a
search and the shaping that turns a scout result into a transcript turn.

```
search/
  SearchControls.tsx — the ask's "Filters" control (year/field popover). It
                       rides BESIDE the bar, not in it — see "Who uses it"
                       below. The "Find papers" toggle sat here until
                       v7.18.0; typing `@` replaced it (see `../mentions/`).
  useDirectSearch.ts — run the scout, shape its result into a chat message
  search.css         — styles for the toggles and the filter popover
```

## What changed in v7.6.0, and why

The app used to have **two** text inputs: a search box in the header and the
chat bar in the assistant panel. They asked the same question — "find me
papers about this" — and made you pick a box before you knew which one you
wanted. The header box is gone; the chat bar does both, with a toggle
choosing what the words you typed *are*.

The backend consolidated the same way. There used to be two implementations
of "search papers" — `services/search.live_search` (query-analyst expansion,
verified titles, one lexical search) and the paper scout. Now there is one:
the scout, run without the researcher above it. That is the same principle
the v7.0.0 worker split was made on — *two paths to one source is the bug,
not the feature* — applied one level up. `query_analyst` was retired with it;
its title-recall half became the scout's `match_title` tool.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **The scout's turn is marked complete when it lands** (`turnCompleted`,
  since v7.26.0). It wasn't, and the omission was invisible on screen —
  the list rendered fine — while being total for the model:
  `teacher/history.ts`'s `conversationHistory` drops unfinished turns, so a
  search result never became history for the next question in its thread,
  never travelled through `@thread[…]` to another, and never entered the
  thread's summary. "What other papers appeared in this search?" got "I have
  no record of a prior search". A broken run still stays unfinished, the
  same as an aborted answer.
- **Three destinations, decided before any model runs.** `Teacher`'s submit
  handler branches on plain facts, not on an agent classifying your intent:
  a pasted arXiv id/URL goes straight to the graph (`ID_RE`, no LLM at all);
  a bare `@phrase` that resolved to nothing goes to the scout; otherwise the
  researcher. The id check deliberately runs *first* — you pasted the paper,
  so there is nothing left to search for. (Until v7.18.0 the middle branch was
  a "Find papers" toggle you armed before typing; `../mentions/` has the story
  of why saying it beats switching to it.)
- **The filters bind, and they sit outside the toggle.** `year_from` /
  `year_to` / `fields` ride in the scout's **deps**, not its prompt, so no
  wording the model picks can widen them (it may narrow further inside them —
  see `agents/workers/search/papers`). They apply to the researcher's paper
  searches too, which is why they are the *bar's* filters rather than direct
  search's: a reader who narrows to 2020+ compsci means it either way. What
  they never touch is `expand_node` — filtering a reference list by year
  wouldn't narrow a search, it would hide real citations and leave the graph
  lying about what cites what.
- **A result is an ordinary assistant turn, streamed the ordinary way.**
  `useDirectSearch` has **no reducer of its own** — it drives `turnStarted` →
  `traceAdded` → `tokenAppended` → `paperRefsSet`, the same four a streamed
  answer walks. So the turn appears the instant you hit send, the transcript
  snaps to the bottom, and `AnswerMarkdown` renders the `[n]` markers against
  `paperRefs` with a click reseeding the graph — all without a line of bespoke
  rendering. A saved session carries direct searches for free, since
  `paperRefs` and `trace` already persist. (The first build landed the
  finished result in one dispatch; a search read as a frozen screen for the
  several seconds it took.)
- **`/api/search` is an SSE stream**, so the scout's lookups arrive as chips
  **while it works** rather than all at once at the end. Each is announced
  when the lookup *starts*, not when it returns — a chip that appears on
  completion reports what already happened; one that appears on issue says
  what is happening now. They are also the whole debugging surface for a thin
  result: one query behind three papers reads very differently from four.
- **The summary leads the list.** A negative result ("nothing indexed after
  2021") is a real finding, and it explains a short list rather than leaving
  the reader wondering.
- **The scout's seed-search brief lives at the call site, not in the shared
  prompt.**
  The scout is told to stop as soon as it has what was asked for — right when
  a researcher is waiting, wrong when a *reader* is. The first build of this
  returned exactly one paper for "dqn": correct, and useless, because there
  was nothing to choose between. `routes/search.py`'s `_PICKER_BRIEF` asks for
  a spread instead. Same worker, different consumer.
- **The year slider spans the whole corpus (1800 → now), by Patrick's
  call** — full access beats track precision. The fold-to-null trick makes
  that free: a handle parked at an endpoint reads as "no bound", so the
  default full-width slider IS the empty filter (and doesn't light the
  active-filter badge). Two overlapping `<input type=range>` elements share
  one track; the low handle z-indexes on top at the far right so it stays
  grabbable.
- **The field picker lazy-loads and follows the provider.** The selected
  provider's field vocabulary (`getFields(provider)` → `/api/taxonomy/<provider>`
  → `{id, name}[]`) fetches only when the popover first opens; the options are
  refetched when the provider changes. The picker shows `name` and stores the
  `id` as the filter value (S2 field name / OpenAlex numeric field id). The
  two vocabularies are disjoint, so the backend drops values that don't belong
  to the active provider (`services/search.valid_fields`).
- **The popover spans its whole row, not the button.** It anchors to whichever
  container the pair lands in — `.ask-tools` with no graph, the sticky
  `.section-head` with one — never to the little toggle that opens it, because
  a popover the width of a button has no room for a year slider. Direction
  follows the room: upward from the tool row (which sits at the bottom of the
  column, under the bar), downward from the Chat row (which is pinned near the
  top), and downward again on the empty landing surface, where the whole
  composer floats at the optical centre.
- **The instant cache search is gone from the frontend — not from the
  product.** `searchLocal` and `/api/local_search` were deleted, because the
  scout reads that same cache *inside* its own `search` tool: a rate-limited
  provider still answers from graphs you have already loaded. What was
  actually lost is time-to-first-paint (cached hits used to render while the
  live search was in flight). That was judged the cheaper half of "one path to
  one source"; restoring an instant tier is a small change if it ever feels
  slow.

## Who uses it, and how/why

`Teacher` renders `SearchControls` beside `ScopePicker` — always the two
together, for the same reason: they belong to the thing you are about to send.
It owns the `direct` / `searchOptions` state, passes the options to
`useDirectSearch` **and** to `ask` (which forwards them to the researcher), and
places the pair in one of two rows depending on the panel's shape: a chip row
directly under the ask bar with no graph, the Chat section's caret row with
one. **Never inside the bar itself, since v7.11.0** — three controls and a text
field made the box you type in read as a toolbar. The header that used to hold
the search box is gone entirely (v7.8.0).

## How it's verified

`tsc -b` strict + oxlint + prettier. `test/search/useDirectSearch.test.ts`
pins the reducer sequence (`turnStarted` → `answerSet` → `paperRefsSet` →
`turnCompleted`), that the finished turn is in `conversationHistory`, and
that a broken run stays unfinished; the binding filters are pinned
server-side, where they are actually enforced
(`test/curious_astronaut/agents/workers/search/papers/test_main.py`), along with the
route's SSE frames and its nickname resolve (`test/curious_astronaut/routes/test_search.py`).
