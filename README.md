# Curious Astronaut

**Explore how research papers connect — and have an AI teacher narrate the
story of how a field got here.**

Drop in a paper and Curious Astronaut renders a **Connected-Papers-style interactive
graph** of how it links to the literature — the papers it cites (its
intellectual ancestors), the papers that cite it (its descendants), and its
nearest neighbors by meaning. Then wander: double-click any node to re-center
the graph on it and keep exploring.

Each **exploration** contains a permanent **General** discussion and a thread
for each graph. Switching threads restores that graph and its conversation.
Paper citations highlight the current graph; graph icons open or resume a graph
thread directly. Type **@** and pick another discussion from the suggestions to
bring it into the agent's context. Lectures remain part of their thread's history, including follow-up
questions after a reload. Existing saved sessions migrate lazily when opened.

It connects to the academic-graph ecosystem **dynamically** — there's no local
corpus of papers to store. The only things kept on disk are a small cache of
the graphs you've looked at, your saved sessions, and the library of sources
you upload (embedded locally; nothing leaves your machine).

**Why it exists.** Curious Astronaut is free software (MIT), built to put research and
self-teaching within reach of anyone who wants to learn something — not to
become a product. It runs on your own machine, and the sources you upload
never leave it. If something with more reach ever does this better, good;
until then this exists, and you can have it.

> **The teacher runs on whichever model you point it at, including free ones.**
> The graph explorer is keyless and free. For the AI teacher, pick a vendor:
> **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** runs a model on your own machine — no key,
> no signup, no cost, nothing leaving the computer — or **Google AI Studio**
> issues a free-tier key, or use paid **Anthropic** / **OpenAI** if you have
> one. Any OpenAI-compatible server (Groq, OpenRouter, LM Studio) works
> through the OpenAI entry too. It is a **per-agent** choice, so a sensible
> setup runs the lecturer locally and leaves the one agent that needs web
> search on a cloud vendor. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Setup

The toolchain (python, uv, nodejs, trivy, gh) is pinned in `.tool-versions` —
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) installs it all with `mise install` (mise reads
the asdf-format file and works on Windows and macOS alike). With mise in
place, `bin/setup.bat` (Windows) or `bin/setup.sh` (macOS/Linux) does the full
bootstrap: pinned tools, a full `uv sync` (dev tooling, the notebook
`research` group, and every optional extra), and the frontend install + build.
Without mise, `uv` and `Node.js` installed any other way work fine too.

> **Three capabilities are optional extras**, because they are most of the
> install and a reader who only wants the graph and the teacher needs none of
> them — core is **83 MB** against **1.0 GB** with everything:
>
> | Extra | Gives you | Cost |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | *(core)* | the graph explorer and the AI teacher | 83 MB |
> | `pdf` | figures, tables and algorithm boxes mined from PDFs | +54 MB |
> | `corpus` | the offline Semantic Scholar citations corpus | +44 MB |
> | `sources` | search over your own uploaded books and PDFs | +~800 MB |
>
> `bin/setup` installs all of them. To pick: `uv sync --extra pdf`, or
> `pip install 'curious-astronaut[pdf,corpus]'`. Nothing breaks without one — the feature
> says it isn't installed and names the command. See
> [docs/first-run.md](docs/first-run.md).

> **Windows pulls a CUDA build of torch** (~1.8GB, from PyTorch's `cu130`
> index) with the `sources` extra, so the local embedder can use a GPU if you
> have one — PyPI's Windows wheel is CPU-only, and that's the whole difference
> between ~80 and ~1500 chunks/s at ingest. It falls back to CPU on a machine
> without a GPU, and macOS/Linux resolve torch from PyPI as usual. See
> [`sources.embedding.device`](docs/configuration.md).

### 1. Configure

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

All configuration lives in `config.json` (gitignored — it holds your keys; no
environment variables, ever). Every field must be *present* and is validated at
startup by Pydantic, so a malformed value fails fast with a clear message — but
the API-key values may be left blank. For the **full value-by-value reference**
(every tunable, its default, and *why* it's there), see
**[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)**.

The two **data-source keys are completely optional** — Curious Astronaut explores the graph
fully without them, just on tighter public rate limits. The **Anthropic key is
the one that unlocks the AI teacher** (lectures, research Q&A, library chat); the
graph explorer runs fine without it, but the Assistant panel needs it.

- **`providers.s2.api_key`** — **optional.** A free
  [Semantic Scholar API key](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api) is
  recommended (the keyless pool is tight), but keyless works.
- **`providers.openalex.api_key`** — **optional.** OpenAlex (the citation
  source) runs keyless on its `mailto` polite pool ($0.10/day of metered search
  — plenty for browsing); a free key at
  [openalex.org/settings/api](https://openalex.org/settings/api) lifts it to
  $1/day. Set `providers.openalex.mailto` to your email either way.
- **`llm.providers`** — **one block per LLM vendor; fill in at least one to
  power the agents.** Four are wired, and two of them cost nothing:
  - **`ollama.base_url`** — **free and local.** Point it at a running
    [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server (normally `http://localhost:11434/v1`,
    keep the `/v1`). No key, no signup, no quota, and the conversation never
    leaves your machine. The one trade: a local model can't search the web, so
    that scout goes quiet rather than inventing sources.
  - **`google.api_key`** — **free tier.** A key from
    [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), quota-limited.
    The free quota covers the **flash** models; the pro ones answer
    `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, so pick a `gemini-*-flash*` for each agent.
    A key on a *paid* project with its credits spent fails the same way even
    on flash — if everything 429s, check billing rather than the model name.
  - **`anthropic.api_key`** — paid. A
    [Claude API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
  - **`openai.api_key`** / **`openai.base_url`** — paid at OpenAI, but the
    `base_url` points the same vendor block at **any OpenAI-compatible
    server** (Groq, OpenRouter, Together, LM Studio), several with free tiers.

  Which vendor each agent uses is set per agent in `llm.agents`
  (`"model": "ollama:qwen3:8b"`), so mixing them is normal — and each vendor
  in Settings ▸ Agents ▸ Model Providers has a **"Use for all agents"** button
  that puts the lecturer and researcher on its advanced model and the
  summarizer and scouts on its light one, in one click.

### 2. Build the frontend & run

**Single-server** (serves the built frontend + API together):

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
uv run astronaut serve                      # http://127.0.0.1:5000
uv run astronaut serve --port 5050          # ...or another port (--host to expose it)
```

**Development** (two terminals, hot-reloading frontend):

```bash
uv run astronaut serve                      # Terminal 1 — API
cd frontend && npm run dev                    # Terminal 2 — http://localhost:5173
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to Flask.

## Using it

1. **Find a paper** — everything starts in the **chat bar**; there is no
   separate search box. Ask a research question and the assistant goes
   looking, or **type `@`** to name a paper: suggestions appear as you type,
   and picking one attaches that exact paper to your message. What happens
   next depends on what you said — the same rule a pasted id has always
   followed, that naming one paper and nothing else is a statement of intent:

   | What you send | What it does |
   | --- | --- |
   | `@` + a paper you picked | lands on that paper's graph |
   | `@` + words nothing matched | searches properly and lists what it found |
   | a question with `@…` in it | answers *from* that paper, leaving your graph alone |
   | an **arXiv id / URL** | goes straight to the graph, no model involved |

   The suggestions arrive in two passes: your **cached papers appear as you
   type** (a local scan — free, offline, no wait), then a real search fills the
   list out when you pause, re-ranked so the paper whose title most nearly *is*
   what you typed leads. While that second pass runs, the panel says which
   phase it is on — *"Searching Semantic Scholar"*, *"Working out which paper
   'dqn' is"* — rather than a bare spinner. So a paper you have never opened
   is still nameable, and one you have seen shows up instantly. (There was a
   **🔍 Find papers** toggle for this until
   v7.18.0. It made the same words mean different things depending on a
   button's state, and it couldn't express "answer from *this* paper" at all.)
   A search streams: cached papers appear immediately (⚡ **opens instantly**
   marks the ones whose whole neighborhood is cached, so a click costs no API
   call), then the scout's finds arrive lookup by lookup with a trace chip
   each. The **Filters** popover holds a publication-year window (1800 → now)
   and **fields of study** — hard limits, not hints, and they bind the
   assistant's own paper searches too (though never an `@` lookup: you named
   that paper, so a filter has no business hiding it). Citation links on the graph are never
   filtered.
2. **Read the map** — 🟡 seed · 🔵 references · 🟢 citations.
   (💗 found-by-search too, on a session saved before v7.3.0 — free-text hits
   used to be drawn as edgeless pink dots; now the assistant numbers what it
   finds and you promote a paper onto the graph by clicking its citation.)
   **Every paper that cites the seed is one `citations` relation** — from the
   historic giants to work published this month — and **which of them matters is
   yours to decide** with the year and citation-count sliders, not ours to
   decide with a threshold. (They were two relations, *Field Landmarks* and
   *Latest Publications*, until v7.17.0.)

   Behind that one relation are still **two queries**, because they have to be:
   the most-cited citers come back ranked by citation count (under **OpenAlex**,
   the true all-time top-cited from a sorted `cites:` query; under **Semantic
   Scholar**, the whole citation history when the offline corpus serves it or the
   seed's citer list is fully reachable live — the graph's own note names which
   source is behind them; see
   [docs/citation-coverage.md](docs/citation-coverage.md) for how the two sources
   compare), with **how many to show measured per-seed from the real citer pool**
   (an old classic maps out large, a young hot paper stays tight — the STOP rule
   in `services/graph/budget.py`). A second query runs **per recent year**, and
   it is the only reason recent work appears at all: citation counts measure
   attention *and* elapsed time together, so a paper from this year never
   survives a citation ranking. Its start year is **sized per-seed from fitted
   constants** so an old classic's coverage reaches back to meet its dense
   cluster instead of leaving a gap (see `services/graph/bands.py`). (Every term
   here — *landmark*, *band*, *tail edge*, the sizing rules — is defined once,
   with a worked example, in
   [docs/landmark-vocabulary.md](docs/landmark-vocabulary.md).) Node size =
   citations; thick links = influential citations; a
   dashed ring = discovered by the teacher mid-chat. Click a node for
   details (TL;DR, abstract/PDF links, arXiv & Semantic Scholar category
   tags, figures — mined straight from the open-access PDF for journal
   papers, tables and algorithms included — code & artifacts);
   **double-click to re-seed** on it — journal papers included. LaTeX math (`$…$`) renders throughout — titles,
   abstracts, lecture beats, answers, and figure captions — via KaTeX.
3. **Declutter** — a new graph opens onto the *graph*: the controls sit folded
   to a slim bar (click its header to open them) and no paper is selected until
   you click one. Inside: Force ↔ Timeline layouts (x = publication date), relation
   on/off **filter chips**, a dual-knob **year slider** and a dual-knob
   **citation-count slider** (a log-scale min…max window over the papers on
   screen — a display filter, no re-query), drag-to-pin, focus-on-hover, and a
   **Refresh** that busts this seed's day-cached snapshot to re-fetch fresh from
   Semantic Scholar. **Hand-pick a scope** with the node selector:
   **alt-drag** a marquee to add papers to the teacher's scope (additive —
   several sweeps build one cluster), **shift-click** to add/remove one, and
   **alt-click** empty (or **Clear**) to reset. Picked papers ring cyan and the
   rest dim; the teacher then grounds only in your selection — even papers a
   filter later hides, which stay drawn with a dotted ring. Click the
   **Curious Astronaut** brand anytime to go home. By default the app **sizes each graph
   for you** (how many landmark citers to ship, where the Latest bands start —
   per seed); turn **"Size graphs automatically" off** in Settings ▸ Graph to
   have it ship everything it can and size the bands yourself, and each filter
   chip gains a **count slider** to trim how many of that relation you see.
4. **Learn** (the 🎓 Assistant panel):
   - **Lecture** — a narrated tour of the papers **you have on screen**,
     oldest first, over the graph as you built it (lectures never expand it —
     only the research agent does). Ask for it in the chat bar: *"lecture me
     on these"*. (There was a Lecture button in the panel until v7.21.0, and a
     `/lecture` command until v7.23.0.)
     **What it covers is your choice, not a menu's:**
     filter to the references and you get the story of how the field arrived
     here; keep only recent work and you get the current frontier; alt-drag a
     cluster and it narrates those; scope it to a single paper and it teaches
     that paper in chapters, reading its full text for the real math — **any**
     paper, not just the seed, so learning about something you found no longer
     means re-seeding the graph on it first. Four mode buttons did that carving
     for you until v7.17.0 — and in doing so *overrode* whatever you had
     filtered or selected.
     **What a turn is about follows one rule, for lectures and questions
     alike:** what your message asks for, else your hand-picked selection,
     else what your filters show. So the **filter chips** (the seed included
     — it has its own chip), the **year range**, the **citation window** and
     the per-chip count sliders set the *default* — narrow the view and
     "lecture me on these" or "which of these used dropout?" covers what's
     left. A selection outranks them (a picked paper a slider later hides
     stays in scope and stays drawn, dotted). And **the message outranks
     both** — *"lecture me on the references"*, *"what do the citations say
     about entropy?"*, *"on the seed"*, *"on the Bekenstein paper and Hawking
     1975"*, *"what does Hawking 1975 argue?"*, *"lecture me on the whole
     graph"* (the lot, past every filter), plus a period on top of any of
     those — *"the references from the 2010s"*, *"the last five years"* (a
     period also bounds what the researcher goes looking for that turn).
     Those papers become the selection — ringed, drawn even if a chip or
     slider hides them, narrated or answered over — and stay selected
     afterwards, exactly as if you'd marqueed them (Esc clears). Each reply
     says what it was scoped to (*"Scoped to the references, 2010–2019 · 12
     papers"*). A bare period (*"the papers between 2016 and 2017"*) narrows
     what you were already looking at rather than reaching past the year
     slider. A message that asks for papers the graph doesn't have says so
     instead of quietly answering over everything. When a lecture finishes
     the whole of it stays lit (click its bubble any time to light it again,
     Esc to clear).
     **One choice the scope can't make for you, so your words make it:**
     say *history* — *"the story of"*, *"how we got here"* — and the papers
     are told as a chronological arc; otherwise they are grouped into their
     key themes. Summary is the default because a chronological arc is a
     strong claim to make about an arbitrary selection.
     The lecture is nudged to span the whole publication history it is given —
     both ends, not just the oldest, most-cited papers. Length is tunable
     (`min_beats`/`max_beats` in the lecturer's config `extras`, default 7–12).
     **The lecture arrives as a reply in the conversation**, beats and all,
     behind its own caret — open when it lands, folding itself when the next
     lecture arrives, so a conversation with four lectures in it stays
     readable. Beats light up their papers and carry the papers' **real
     figures** inline — click to enlarge.
     So the docked panel is one thing: the conversation, with the 📚 source
     scope and ▽ filters on its caret row. It was a stack of two folding
     sections from v7.10.0, a **Lecture** section above a **Chat** one, which
     was itself a fix for an older shape where the two took turns and asking a
     question tucked away the lecture you were reading.
     **You don't have to say "lecture".** *"Summarize these papers for me"*,
     *"what's the story here?"* — the lecturer answers just the same (the
     last of those arrives framed as history, because that is what it asked
     for). The composer works out which assistant you meant: phrasings that
     name a lecture outright and point at nothing in particular are matched
     outright, and anything less obvious — including *which* papers — is
     settled by a quick classifier: *"summarize this"* is a question about
     the paper you have open, *"summarize these papers"* is a lecture, and
     no pattern tells those apart. Every turn it guessed on says which
     assistant answered and offers the other in a click, so a wrong guess
     costs one line rather than a re-typed question.
   - **Ask** — the research agent answers grounded in what it actually
     reads, streaming its tool steps live (read / expand / search the
     literature / search the web / search your sources / show a figure). It
     consults **every source it has** before it commits to an answer — it
     can't know which one holds it until it looks, and an answer written from
     memory over the textbook you uploaded is the failure that matters. The
     sources also feed each other: the web names things (a chip, a model, a
     lab result) and the literature indexes them, so a web finding sends the
     agent back after **the paper behind the announcement** — the one thing of
     the two you can seed a whole graph on. Answers render in full **Markdown + math**,
     and their inline `[n]` citations are **clickable** — click one to spotlight
     that paper on the graph, click it again to clear. (Lecture beats cite the
     same way.) A tiny glyph on each chip says which click you're about to
     make: **one node lit** spotlights a paper already on the canvas, **three
     nodes wired together** builds that paper's own graph. Answers also cite their whole grounding set — click the bubble
     to re-light them all. A claim drawn from **your own uploaded sources** is
     attributed with its real title and page, resolved server-side rather than
     written out by the model.
     Underneath each answer, a line says what actually grounded it — which of
     your sources, which papers, how much of the web — computed from what the
     agent did, not from what it claims. When nothing grounded it, it says that too: Curious Astronaut grounds
     answers in real material, and is honest when it can't. A lecture gets the
     same line, saying how many papers it narrated.
     **And a turn tells you which graph it came from, once that stops being
     obvious.** The conversation survives a graph load — seed something new and
     your questions come with you — so a transcript can hold turns about
     several different graphs at once. Those older turns quietly go inert:
     their citations grey out, because the papers they point at are no longer
     loaded. So any turn answered over a graph other than the one you are
     looking at says *"From the “…” graph"* at the top, which is the difference
     between a dead link and an answer that explains itself.
   - **No graph open? Then the assistant *is* the page.** Curious Astronaut opens on a
     centred chat bar — no graph and no uploaded library required — and the
     same agent answers seedless, searching your library through its tools
     rather than being handed passages, so a greeting stays a greeting and a
     real question gets looked up first. Its citations are the way *in*:
     clicking one **maps that paper** — builds its graph, with nothing selected
     on it — and the conversation comes with you rather than being cleared, so a
     survey answer is a doorway into the graph instead of a list of links out
     to someone else's site. When a graph appears the chat collapses into the
     side panel beside it (and a 🎓 button at the top-right of the canvas
     brings it back) without dropping the thread or your place in it.
5. **Your sources** (📚) — drop in PDFs (parallel, with live embedding
   progress) or paste URLs; scope any conversation to a subset of them.
6. **Explorations** — every sitting saves itself, so there is no Save button:
   ask a question and it appears in the rail, named after what you asked, kept
   up to date as you work. Leave an answer running and start another
   exploration — it keeps going in the background and is waiting when you come
   back.
7. **Lost?** Hit the header's **?** for a guided coach-mark tour — it auto-runs
   once on first launch (the search surface) and once more on your first graph
   (the graph tools), spotlighting one control at a time; the bubble's title
   doubles as a jump select that skips straight to whichever tip you came
   back for.

## The codebase

The rewrite's first principle: **every package documents itself**. Start at
any folder's `README.md` — e.g. `src/curious_astronaut/agents/` (the two tiers —
orchestrators that own an outcome, workers that own one source each — plus
the event protocol and the streaming bridge), `services/sources/` (hybrid retrieval:
FTS5 + vectors + RRF), `frontend/src/README.md` (the render-tree map), or
`frontend/src/store/` (what earns a Redux slice and what stays local).

Quality gates: `uv run nox` runs the whole repo's — pre-commit hooks (file
hygiene; ruff incl. Google-style docstring rules; a repo-local
no-single-letter-identifiers AST check, notebooks included; pydoclint for
Args/Returns completeness; the frontend's prettier + oxlint incl. JSDoc
completeness and `id-length`, the frontend half of that same naming rule),
strict mypy, pytest (`test/`, 669 offline tests), and Vitest
(`frontend/test/`, offline too) — plus `cd frontend && npm run build`
(strict tsc + Vite) for the type/build check.

All of that also runs in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push to
`main`, across `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`. CI installs the pinned
toolchain from `.tool-versions` with mise, so it runs the *same* python / uv /
node / trivy the developer machines do — and because Trivy is genuinely on
PATH there, the security scan actually runs rather than skipping. It reuses
`bin/setup.sh` rather than restating it, with `CA_SKIP_TORCH=1`, which
drops the `sources` extra: nothing in the gate needs torch, and skipping it
avoids dragging the 37 Linux CUDA packages into every run (1.0 GB → 304 MB).
The `pdf` and `corpus` extras *are* installed there — those tests build real
PDFs and query real Parquet. A second workflow (`release.yml`) fires on
`v*` tags: it fails if the tag and `pyproject.toml`'s version disagree, then
builds the frontend, builds the sdist and wheel, verifies the artifacts carry
the bundled SPA and no local state, and publishes to TestPyPI and then PyPI via
trusted publishing (no stored token).

For the project's direction and past, two living docs sit beside the code:
**[OnePager.md](OnePager.md)** (the vision, the full feature stack, and the
open backlog) and **[docs/history.md](docs/history.md)** (the complete shipped
record, version by version).
