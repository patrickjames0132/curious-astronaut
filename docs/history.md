## Roadmap — shipped

### Reach & access

- [x] **The heavy capabilities became optional extras — a 1.0 GB install is
      now 83 MB** *(v7.15.0)* — the first step of the first-run sequence scoped
      in [first-run.md](first-run.md), and the only one that is pure
      subtraction. Three capabilities moved to
      `[project.optional-dependencies]`: **`sources`**
      (sentence-transformers + torch, searching your own uploads),
      **`pdf`** (PyMuPDF, mining figures), **`corpus`** (DuckDB, the offline S2
      citations corpus). A reader who wants the graph and the teacher — which
      is the whole product for most people — installs none of them.

      | Install | Size |
      | --- | --- |
      | Core | **83 MB** |
      | + `pdf` | 137 MB |
      | + `corpus` | 181 MB |
      | + `sources` | ~1.0 GB |

      Also deleted: **`scikit-learn`, `joblib` and `numpy`**, declared in
      `pyproject.toml` and imported nowhere in the repo — leftovers from the
      `ml_pipelines/`+`research/` plumbing removed 2026-07-22.

      **A latent startup crash surfaced on the way.** `corpus/source.py`
      imported `duckdb` at *module* scope and
      `integrations/semantic_scholar/__init__.py` imports `corpus`, so the
      moment DuckDB became optional an install without it could not have served
      a graph at all — the same shape as the v7.14.0 keyless crash, one release
      later, in a different package. That is why the split shipped with an
      **enforced invariant** rather than a convention:
      `test_no_module_imports_an_optional_package_at_module_scope` parses every
      module in `src/curious_astronaut` and fails on any module-scope import of an optional
      package (`TYPE_CHECKING` blocks exempt, since
      `from __future__ import annotations` makes them free). Verified to fail on
      the pre-split code.

      **`optional.py` is the seam**, and it has two halves for two situations.
      `require(module, extra)` raises `MissingExtra` naming the capability in
      the reader's terms and the exact install command — because
      `No module named 'fitz'` tells someone who just installed Curious Astronaut nothing.
      `available(extra)` is the *ask before doing* half, for code that would
      rather degrade quietly: the embedder calls it and logs one line about
      falling back to lexical search instead of dumping a traceback for what is
      a supported way to install. That is the web scout's `supports_web_search`
      pattern (v7.13.0) applied to packaging.

      **CI got the same win**: `CA_SKIP_TORCH=1` now drops the `sources`
      extra rather than deselecting one package, taking the Linux environment
      from 1.0 GB to 304 MB. `pdf` and `corpus` stay installed there — those
      tests build real PDFs and query real Parquet.

      **Verified by installing it, not by reasoning about it:** a core-only venv
      boots, answers `/api/health`, registers the graph routes, and reports each
      absent capability by name. The same experiment against a non-editable
      `pip install .` failed on config discovery
      (`FileNotFoundError: .../lib/python3.14/config.example.json`) — the
      `PROJECT_ROOT` problem first-run.md predicted, and the next step's first
      task. **Not verified:** what the *browser* shows when a core-only install
      is asked to mine a PDF; the Python side says the right thing, the UI path
      is untested. *(2026-08-28.)*

- [x] **The agent model dropdowns list what each vendor actually offers**
      *(v7.14.0)* — the model names for Google and OpenAI were a hand-written
      list in `routes/settings.py` (`KNOWN_MODELS`, shipped v7.13.0), and it
      rotted in three weeks: Google retired the 2.5 line for new users, so
      picking the only Gemini models Curious Astronaut offered answered `404 ... no longer
      available to new users`. A hardcoded list of a thing the vendor controls
      rots by construction, and behind a `<select>` it is not a stale hint but
      a wall — every option dead and no way past it.

      **Every vendor is now fetched live** from its own listing API, joining
      Anthropic (`client.models.list()`) and Ollama (`/api/tags`), which
      already were. The OpenAI fetch honours `base_url`, so it lists an
      OpenAI-*compatible* server too rather than assuming OpenAI proper.
      `KNOWN_MODELS` survives only as the offline fallback for when a listing
      can't be reached, and now prefers non-versioned aliases
      (`gemini-flash-latest`) that cannot go stale even if nobody touches it
      again.

      **A raw listing is not a menu.** It answers with everything the key can
      reach — Whisper, Sora, `nano-banana-pro-preview`, embeddings, robotics,
      music, TTS — none of which can run an agent, and 77 entries where six
      are relevant is a worse dropdown than none. Filtering is an **allowlist
      of families** per vendor (`gpt-`/`o1`/`o3`/`o4`, `gemini-`/`gemma-`,
      `claude-`) plus a modality strip for the `-tts`/`-image`/`-audio`
      variants that live *inside* an allowed family. A blocklist was tried
      first and leaked immediately; the allowlist hides an unheard-of family
      rather than offering it, which is the safe direction — a missing
      suggestion costs keystrokes, a suggestion that can't run an agent costs
      a failed lecture. Results are ordered by family, because
      reverse-alphabetical alone sorted OpenAI's `o1`/`o3` above every `gpt-`.

      **A listing is fresher, never validated** — Google's `models.list` still
      returns `gemini-2.5-flash` to a key that 404s calling it. Nothing
      downstream may treat a listed model as one that works; that is written
      into the code so a later cleanup doesn't assume otherwise.
      *(Found 2026-08-27 by Patrick, browser-testing the keyless fix above.
      Full story of the wrong turn in [bugs.md](bugs.md).)*

- [x] **The app starts with no LLM configured at all — and a settings change
      no longer needs a restart** *(v7.14.0)* — the keyless graph explorer was
      unreachable on the machines it was written for. Every agent built its
      model at *import* (`agent = Agent(factory.build_model(AGENT_ID), ...)`
      at module level in all five agent packages), so importing the app
      constructed a provider for whatever vendor each agent named; with that
      vendor's block blank, construction raised and `create_app` never
      returned. README.md and `docs/configuration.md` both promised the
      explorer ran free and keyless — a promise that held for everyone except
      the person who couldn't pay, which is the exact failure the *Reach &
      access* theme exists to prevent.

      **A second bug turned out to be the same line.** `config.reload_config`
      folds fresh values into the *existing* config object precisely so
      "every consumer holds the module-level `config` and reads its fields
      late" — the codebase's own convention. The agents were the sole
      exception, so they held a model built from boot-time config forever:
      changing an agent's vendor or model in the settings modal saved
      correctly, round-tripped correctly, and changed nothing until restart.
      The modal's "no restart" promise was true for every setting except the
      ones v7.13.0 had just built it to change. The web scout had it twice
      over — its `capabilities=[WebSearch(...)]` was decided at import too,
      so a vendor switch could leave it silent on a searching vendor or
      searching on one that couldn't.

      **The fix is `factory.model_for(agent_id)`:** build on first use, cache
      against a **fingerprint of the config that produced it** (the agent's
      `provider:model` string plus the named vendor's whole block, so an
      edited key invalidates as surely as a switched vendor does), and pass
      the model to the *run* rather than to the `Agent` —
      `agent.run(..., model=...)`. Three candidate shapes were priced first
      (a lazy `Model` proxy, a cached per-package accessor, per-run passing);
      per-run won because PydanticAI accepts a model-less `Agent` and takes
      `model=` on every run method, so it needed **no proxy over the `Model`
      ABC** and therefore no surface to drift on upgrade. `streams.drive`
      already forwarded `**kwargs`, so the streaming path changed by exactly
      one argument, and the web scout's `capabilities` moved to the same call.
      Caching matters because constructing a model builds an HTTP client:
      per-run construction would churn connections, never caching would leak
      them. A thread race only builds the same model twice, so no lock.

      **The guard is the test that was impossible to write before**:
      `test_app_starts_with_no_llm_vendor_configured_at_all` blanks every
      vendor block, reloads all five agent modules (the failure was
      import-time, and they are long since imported by the time the suite
      runs), and asserts `/api/health` still answers — verified to fail on the
      pre-fix code, which is the only reason to trust it. Full story in
      [bugs.md](bugs.md). *(Found 2026-08-21 while wiring multi-provider
      support; pre-existing, not introduced by it. Fixed 2026-08-26.)*

- [x] **Four LLM vendors, chosen per agent (v7.13.0)** — the AI teacher ran on
      Claude only, so unlocking it required a paid Anthropic key: a credit card,
      plus per-token cost for every lecture and question. The graph explorer was
      free and keyless; the teaching — the point of the project — was not. Under
      the purpose stated in [OnePager.md](../OnePager.md)'s *Why it exists*, that
      was the single largest barrier between a learner and the product, which is
      why this led the backlog rather than sitting in tech debt where it was
      first filed.

      **What shipped.** `agents/factory.py`'s `build_model` became the whole
      vendor seam: a match on the entry's `"<vendor>:<model>"` prefix
      constructing the matching PydanticAI pair — `anthropic`, `openai`,
      `google`, `ollama`. Adding a vendor is now one case arm plus a config
      block, with no agent package touched. `config.llm.providers` gained a
      block per vendor (present-but-blank means *not configured*, the same rule
      the data-provider keys follow), and `LLMProvidersConfig.configured_vendors()`
      reports what is actually usable.

      **The free path was the point, not the vendor count.** Adding OpenAI beside
      Anthropic swaps one credit card for another; **Ollama** (local, no key, no
      signup, nothing leaving the machine) and **Google**'s free tier are what
      change who can use Curious Astronaut. OpenAI's `base_url` was included for the same
      reason — the one adapter also drives Groq, OpenRouter, Together and LM
      Studio, several with free tiers.

      **Vendors are per agent, not global**, which turned out to matter more than
      expected: the web scout's search runs *provider-side*, and a local model has
      none. Rather than let a search-less model invent sources — the failure mode
      that actually occurs — `factory.supports_web_search` gates the capability at
      construction, and `scout()` returns empty **without calling the model** when
      it is absent. So "run everything locally" honestly costs web grounding, and
      leaving that one agent on a cloud vendor is a supported mix.

      **Settings.** The Agents section became two nav sub-pages (*Model Providers*,
      *Agent Settings*) under a landing page, with foldable group headings, a cost
      badge per vendor, and each agent's model split into a Vendor select and a
      Model select — the single `"vendor:model"` dropdown had hidden the vendor
      inside a string. `GET /api/settings/models` now returns per-vendor listings
      plus `known`, which lists **every** vendor whether configured or not: the two
      free paths are precisely what a newcomer has not set up, so offering only
      what already works would hide the options most worth finding. The scouts got
      settings rows for the first time. Four UI shapes were tried and rejected in
      browser testing (tabs, cards, an aligned table, cards again) before landing
      here.

      **Known limit at ship time:** the wiring is covered by tests, but no
      non-Anthropic vendor had executed a lecture end to end when this merged.

### Foundation & the v2 rewrite

- [x] **Phase 0 — One-pager** (this file)
- [x] **Phase 1 — Backend pivot to Semantic Scholar** *(v1.0.0)* —
      `semantic_scholar.py` client (batch hydration to dodge the single-GET
      throttle, 429 backoff, optional `S2_API_KEY`), `graph.py` neighborhood
      builder, thin `cache.py` (graph snapshots), new `/api/graph` & `/api/paper`
      routes. Seed accepts an arXiv id **or** a raw S2 paperId. *(The deeper
      teardown of the legacy digest backend was completed later — see
      **Phase 2.3 — Legacy teardown** below.)*

- [x] **v2.0.0 — the readability rewrite** *(2026-07-06)* — the whole app
      rebuilt file-by-file in a walkthrough (explain → refactor → test → sync),
      with a README in every package. Backend: `config.json` + Pydantic config
      (no env vars), strict mypy, typed `Graph` models, the teacher reborn as a
      **PydanticAI agent crew** (query_analyst / librarian / lecturer /
      researcher behind a deterministic orchestrator; typed event stream;
      everything streams for real — required Anthropic's eager tool-input
      streaming). Search moved **arXiv → all of Semantic Scholar** with LLM
      query expansion + title resolution and whole-result caching; the `arxiv`
      package and the claude-CLI backend retired. Frontend: strict TS, Redux
      Toolkit (3 slices: workspace/transcript/highlight), the 743-line
      Teacher.tsx and 577-line App.tsx decomposed along the hybrid structure
      rule, ingest progress bars, a Home button, and the **"Curious Astronaut"** rebrand
      (in-app copy; repo name unchanged).
- [x] **`atlas` package rename** *(v2.0.1)* — the backend catches up to the
      in-app rebrand above: `src/arxiv_digest/` → `src/curious_astronaut/`,
      `test/arxiv_digest/` → `test/curious_astronaut/`, every import updated, and the
      console script `arxiv-atlas` → `atlas` (`uv run astronaut serve`).
      `pyproject.toml` has no remaining `arxiv` references. GitHub repo name
      unchanged (`arxiv-digest`) — a separate, un-requested action.


### Graph explorer & timeline

- [x] **Phase 2 — Graph explorer frontend** *(v1.0.0)* — force-directed canvas
      (`react-force-graph-2d`), seed via arXiv search, nodes colored by relation
      / sized by citations / edges typed & directed, detail panel with `tldr`.
      **Declutter controls:** relation filters (refs/citations/similar) with
      counts, a dual-handle **year range** slider, **drag-to-pin** (+ release
      all), **focus-on-hover** dimming, and a papers-shown readout. **Visual
      traversal:** double-click (or "Explore from here") re-seeds the graph on
      any node — journal papers included.
- [x] **Phase 2.2 — Timeline layout** *(v1.3.0, month granularity v1.3.1)* — a
      **Force ↔ Timeline** toggle. Timeline pins each node's x to its **publication
      date** (year + month fraction from S2 `publicationDate`, so papers sit
      *between* the yearly gridlines; the detail panel shows the full date) while
      the sim resolves y; a `d3-force-3d` **collision force** (radius-sized) spreads
      papers out within a year column, and once settled **y is frozen** so a drag
      can't re-scramble the layout. A faint **year axis** is drawn behind the
      graph (labels thinned when zoomed out); narrowing the year slider **zooms
      into that span**. So the chronological lecture sweeps left→right as nodes
      light up. Force was the default at launch (**Timeline became the
      default in v2.4.1**); switching layout releases all pins. (A
      relation-band variant remains a possible later sub-toggle.)
- [x] **Fix: dateless papers in Timeline landed at the far edge** *(v2.3.1)* —
      a paper with no publication year (S2 sometimes just doesn't have one)
      was placed one slot before the earliest real year on the graph — a
      strong, usually-wrong assumption that "unknown date" means "oldest."
      `nodeTimelineX` (`useTimeline.ts`) now defaults a dateless node to the
      **seed's own exact x** — same year *and* month fraction, pixel-aligned
      with the seed's column, not just parked somewhere in its year — falling
      back to the earliest year only if the seed itself has none. (There's no
      day-level precision anywhere in this layout, only year+month, so
      "exact" tops out at whatever precision the seed has — same ceiling
      every other node on the graph is already subject to.)
- [x] **Default to Timeline, not Force** *(v2.4.1)* — a fresh page load, going
      Home, and restoring an old saved session that predates the `layout`
      field all used to fall back to Force; all three now default to
      Timeline instead (`store/workspace.ts`'s `initialState`,
      `workspaceCleared`, and `restoreSession`'s missing-field fallback).
      Sessions that explicitly saved a layout — Force or Timeline — are
      unaffected; this only changes what happens when there's no stored
      preference at all.
- [x] **Loading spinners for graph render + search** *(v2.2.0)* — neither the
      "Building graph…" overlay nor the "Searching Semantic Scholar…" hit-list
      note had any animated feedback, so a slow S2 fetch could read as hung.
      Added a shared `.spin` primitive (centralized in `curious_astronaut.css` — it existed
      once already, duplicated in the library upload flow; de-duped it there
      too) and wired it into both spots. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-06.)*
      **Fixed in v2.2.1:** the "Building graph…" overlay was invisible whenever
      a graph was already on screen (re-seeding, or searching over an existing
      graph) — only worked on the very first load. Root cause:
      `react-force-graph-2d` sets its canvas wrapper's `position: relative`
      inline with no `z-index`, tying it with `.overlay`'s implicit
      `z-index: auto`; CSS then falls back to DOM order, and the canvas
      renders *after* `.overlay` in `GraphExplorer.tsx`, so it painted over it
      once a graph existed to render at all. Gave `.overlay` an explicit
      `z-index: 20`, comfortably above every other floating panel
      (`.controls` at 4, `.hit-list` at 5). Also, bare overlay text read poorly
      against a busy graph still on screen, so a `.canvas-scrim` now dims the
      whole canvas (graph + its controls/legend) and the overlay itself gets a
      contrasting card background — for both the loading and the graph-load
      error state (verified against a real 502 from the running server).
- [x] **Optional per-seed cache clear** *(v2.5.0)* — a **Refresh** button in the
      graph controls (beside Release / Fit) busts the cached graph snapshot
      (`data/digest.db`'s `cache` table) for the current seed on demand, rather
      than only living with the 1-day TTL — useful when S2's data for a paper
      visibly changes mid-session. Reuses the backend's existing `refresh=1`
      path (bypass read → rebuild from S2 → upsert the snapshot), which was
      wired end-to-end but never triggered from the UI. Frontend-only: the
      workspace slice now records the **exact seed reference** the graph was
      loaded with (`seedRef`) so Refresh replays the same string and busts the
      *right* cache key — a double-click re-seed keys by S2 paperId, a search by
      arXiv id — rather than a stale duplicate. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-07.)*

### Search & seeding

- [x] **One `@` list for papers and threads, Enter that does what the lit row
      says, and the scout given the dropdown's nickname resolve** *(v7.26.0)* —
      Patrick's first round on the `@` mention after v7.25.0 (2026-09-17),
      which surfaced as two complaints and grew into six fixes.

      **Enter loaded a graph when he wanted a search.** The dropdown
      pre-highlighted its top row and Enter accepted the highlight, so Enter
      on an untouched list spliced in whichever paper the cache ranked first,
      and Enter again on the bare `@Title` that left behind seeded the graph.
      Now **nothing is selected until the reader selects it** (`highlighted`
      is `-1`, `choice` null, until an arrow or a hover); Enter with no row
      chosen falls through to send, so a bare `@phrase` goes to the scout's
      full search as it did before the dropdown existed. Then the second
      complaint, once that shipped: arrow, Enter, Enter was a press too many.
      Settled as **Enter does the thing, Tab completes**: Enter on a chosen
      paper that is the whole message (`ActiveMention.whole`) picks *and*
      sends in one press; Tab only completes the text; a paper inside a
      sentence, or a thread, completes and waits for the question. Because
      Enter's two jobs are told apart only by whether a row is lit, the
      dropdown's footer says what Enter does *right now* (`hintFor`: five
      states) — and is pinned outside the scrolling list, after Patrick
      noticed it vanished the moment eight rows landed.

      **Threads didn't appear at all.** The tour said "type @thread", which
      reads as "@ plus the thread's name"; that went to the paper lookup,
      because threads lived behind a separate picker keyed on the literal
      word. Offered three shapes (one list / hybrid with a `@thread` filter /
      keep the keyword), Patrick picked **one list**: the exploration's other
      discussions are a section above the paper results, matched by title
      substring with no request at all, from the first character — `@` alone
      lists them, which is how a reader learns they exist. Picking one still
      inserts `@thread[Title]`, the syntax the send path already read;
      `readMessage` now keeps a bare one away from the scout. The keyword
      picker, its regex, state and CSS are gone.

      **A completed mention kept the lookup running.** A mention has no
      closing delimiter, so after a pick the `@` at the start of the message
      still owned everything typed after it — "Searching Semantic Scholar"
      for every keystroke of the question. Pre-existing for papers, noticed
      with `@thread[General] what are some of the other…`. `activeMention`
      now takes the draft's completed texts, and a closed `@thread[…]` ends
      itself. See `docs/bugs.md`.

      **`dqn` led with the wrong paper.** The scout — a text-searching Haiku
      agent — has the blind spot the dropdown fixed in v7.19.0: nothing
      textual reaches *Playing Atari…* from the acronym, so it led with a 2020
      paper *titled* "Deep Q-Networks" and called it canonical. `api_search`
      now runs the same day-cached `paper_by_name` **alongside** the scout
      (its own small thread pool; no added wall-clock) and prepends the
      confirmed paper under the dropdown's exact-title gate. A hit leaves one
      trace chip in the dropdown's words; a miss leaves nothing.

      **A search was invisible to the model.** `useDirectSearch` never marked
      its turn complete, so no scout result ever became history — not for the
      next question in General, not through `@thread[General]`, not in the
      summary. One `turnCompleted`. See `docs/bugs.md`. *(Browser-tested and
      approved by Patrick, 2026-09-17.)*

- [x] **Stream the `@` lookup's real steps as a live line in the dropdown** *(v7.19.0)* —
      while the full pass worked, the panel said only *"Searching…"*. The ask
      (from the developer, 2026-09-09, with the ChatGPT "Searching
      www.bls.gov" line as the reference) was to name what is actually
      happening, the way that line does.

      **The framing needed correcting first, or the labels would have lied.**
      The scout is *not* what runs here — it runs after you send a bare
      unresolved `@phrase`, and that path already streams trace chips into the
      transcript. The dropdown's real steps are three: scanning the reader's
      cached snapshots, the day-cached provider search, and — only when no
      candidate's title equals what was typed — the nickname resolve, which is
      a model call plus a `match_title` verification. The third is the slowest
      and the only one worth watching, and it was exactly the one the frontend
      could not see, because it happened inside the full request.

      **So the full pass now streams**, in the shape `/api/search` next door
      already had: `GET /api/mentions` returns SSE with a `step` frame per
      phase and a `result` frame at the end (`routes/search.py::_mention_stream`),
      while `source=local` stays a plain JSON GET — it is instant, and
      debouncing or framing it would only make the free half feel slower.
      `useMentionSuggestions` reads the stream through the existing `readSSE`
      and holds the latest label in one `step` state; `api/mentions.ts` splits
      into `fetchCachedMentions` (JSON) and `streamMentions` (SSE with
      `onStep`/`onResult`). The frontend could have faked the first two labels
      from which request was in flight, but not the third, so a half-measure
      would have omitted the interesting one.

      Two details the labels turn on. The phase names are **prose the server
      writes**, not provider ids leaking out — `_PROVIDER_NAMES` maps `s2` to
      "Semantic Scholar" so the line reads like a sentence, and the two
      happening to agree elsewhere is a coincidence, not a contract. And the
      nickname step is announced **before** the call, not after: a step frame
      that arrives on completion reports what has already finished, which is
      the one thing a progress line must not do.

      **A live line, not accumulating collapsibles**, despite the ask's
      wording: the reference screenshot is itself one self-replacing line, the
      panel is small and opens upward, and a lookup that finishes in under two
      seconds turns a step history into noise. Each label supersedes the last
      in a `.mention-step` row with `aria-live="polite"`, so a screen reader
      hears the phases without the list being re-announced. Collapsible step
      *history* belongs to the scout run after send, where it already exists as
      trace chips. *(From the developer, 2026-09-09.)*

- [x] **`@` a paper in the chat bar, instead of arming a search mode** *(v7.18.0)* — the
      direct-search toggle (`search/SearchControls.tsx:186`, "Find papers")
      was a *mode* you set before typing: armed, the next message goes to the
      paper scout; unarmed, it goes to the researcher. The ask is to replace
      the mode with in-line syntax — `@<arxiv id | title | search words>`
      anywhere in a message — so finding a paper is something you *say*
      rather than something you switch to.

      **Half of this already exists and is the proof the idea works.**
      `Teacher.tsx:300` runs `ID_RE` on every message and seeds the graph
      directly on a pasted arXiv id/URL — no toggle, no model, and
      deliberately ahead of the toggle check. `@` generalizes that from "the
      whole message is an id" to "a span inside a message is a paper".

      **The real design question is what `@` returns, because the two halves
      of the ask want different things.** `@2103.00020` resolves to exactly
      one paper (seed it, or attach it as context). `@attention is all you
      need` or `@sparse autoencoders` resolves to *candidates*, which is the
      scout's streamed list — and a list is a turn in the transcript, not a
      token in a sentence. Decide up front whether `@` is (a) a **composer
      autocomplete** that resolves to a chip *before* send, so the message
      arrives with a real paper id attached and the researcher gets grounding
      it can trust, or (b) **post-send routing** that turns the message into a
      direct search. (a) is the better product and the larger build (a
      typeahead against the scout's `match_title`, debounced, with the
      rate-limit budget that implies); (b) is nearly free but is the current
      toggle wearing a sigil.

      **What must not be lost with the toggle:** the *Filters* control
      (year/field) sits deliberately **outside** it, because the filters bind
      the researcher's own paper searches too, not just direct search — see
      `search/README.md`. Removing the toggle must leave the filter popover
      where it is, and the popover's copy ("Applies to direct search AND to
      the assistant's own paper searches", `SearchControls.tsx:204`) needs
      rewording once "direct search" is no longer a thing you arm. The tour's
      `data-tour="direct-search"` step goes with it. *(From the developer,
      2026-09-08.)*

      **Shipped as the composer autocomplete, not the cheap post-send
      routing** — the ticket's open question, decided once `local_search`
      turned out to make a typeahead genuinely affordable. `@` opens
      suggestions as you type; picking one attaches a real paper id to the
      message before it is sent. The new `frontend/src/mentions/` package
      holds the grammar (`parse.ts`), the typeahead engine and the dropdown;
      `GET /api/mentions` is the lookup behind it.

      **Three destinations, and still none of them decided by a model.**
      `readMessage` is a substring check and a `startsWith`: a bare resolved
      mention seeds the graph (the rule a pasted arXiv id has always
      followed), a bare *unresolved* one goes to the paper scout (the
      dropdown's fallback, and exactly what the retired toggle did), and a
      mention inside a question grounds the answer — the case the toggle could
      never express at all. A mentioned paper joins that message's numbered
      nodes and is deliberately **never merged onto the canvas**: asking about
      a paper is not asking to explore it.

      **Two lookups on two clocks, which took two goes to get right.** It
      shipped as one blocking call serving both sources, and that was wrong in
      a way worth recording: the cache-first *ordering* was real but the
      cache-first *timing* was not, because the response still waited on the
      provider. Split, the cache-only pass now runs on every keystroke with no
      debounce (free, offline, milliseconds) while the provider pass waits for
      a pause, aborts its predecessor, and re-ranks the whole list by how well
      each title answers what was typed.

      **The nickname problem, and the one model call it justifies.** `@dqn`
      returned a page of DQN-*titled* papers without *Playing Atari with Deep
      Reinforcement Learning* anywhere in it. Measured before building
      anything: S2 free-text cannot reach that paper for that query even at
      limit 30, `match_title('dqn')` returns nothing, and no field of the
      cached node — title, authors, abstract, tldr, venue — contains the
      string, because the 2013 paper predates the name. The mapping is world
      knowledge, so `summarizer.title_for_paper_name` proposes the real title
      and the provider **verifies it exists** before it is shown (a model
      asked for a title will produce one whether or not it knows the paper).
      It reuses the summarizer's agent id rather than adding a sixth entry to
      Agent Settings — the precedent the conversation titler set — never runs
      on the free pass, is skipped when a title already equals the query, and
      is day-cached per name *including misses*.

      **Two of my own mistakes are pinned by tests rather than quietly
      fixed:** the first gate on that model call asked "does any title
      *contain* the query?", which would have suppressed the resolve in
      exactly the `@dqn` case that prompted it — text matching finding
      something is not the same as finding the thing; and the re-rank
      initially tracked the keyboard selection by index, which moves the row
      under a reader mid-arrow, so it tracks the paper's id instead.

      **What the toggle's removal did not take with it:** the ▽ Filters
      control, which always bound the researcher's own paper searches and so
      was never direct search's. It binds everything except an `@` lookup —
      you named that paper, so a filter has no business hiding it, which is
      the reading `match_title` already took.

- [x] **One bar: the search box folds into the chat bar, and direct search
      becomes the paper scout** *(v7.6.0)* — the app had **two text inputs**
      asking the same question. Header search went straight from a title to a
      graph; the chat bar asked the assistant and got papers back. Both mean
      "find me papers about this", and having them in two boxes made you pick
      the box before you knew which one you wanted. *(Patrick's question,
      2026-08-14, sharpened over a long design argument that changed the
      answer — see below.)*

      **The shape.** The chat bar is now the app's only text input, with three
      destinations decided **before any model runs**: a pasted arXiv id/URL
      goes straight to the graph (`ID_RE`, no LLM at all, checked first
      because you pasted the paper); the 🔍 **Find papers** toggle sends the
      **paper scout, alone** — no researcher above it, one Haiku call; and
      anything else goes to the researcher as always. Results land in the
      transcript as an ordinary assistant turn, so `AnswerMarkdown` renders
      the `[n]` markers against `paperRefs`, a click reseeds the graph, and a
      saved session keeps it — with no bespoke rendering anywhere.

      **What it retired.** `services/search.live_search` (query-analyst
      expansion → verified titles → one lexical search), `/api/local_search`,
      the whole **`query_analyst` agent**, `Search.tsx`, `HitList.tsx`, and
      `useSeedSearch`. That was a second implementation of "search papers"
      sitting beside the scout — the same duplication the v7.0.0 worker split
      exists to prevent (*"two paths to one source is the bug, not the
      feature"*), one level up. Both halves of the analyst outlived it in
      better form: the scout **reformulates** across attempts rather than
      expanding once (it can see what came back), and its new **`match_title`**
      tool resolves a recalled title directly — chosen when the scout
      recognizes a name, instead of every query paying for a recall attempt.

      **The argument that changed the design.** The first proposal was to keep
      direct search deterministic in code and merge only the UI, on four
      objections: the analyst's title recall, an unenforceable field filter,
      the cache-first path, and the pasted-id fast path. Patrick answered each
      with the same move — *put it in `RunContext[Deps]`, not the prompt* —
      and was right. The crux ("filters and non-determinism don't mix") was
      **wrong**: determinism comes from *where the value lives*, not from
      whether a model is in the loop. A filter read out of deps inside the
      tool is exactly as binding as a query param, the same way `provider` and
      `known_ids` already bind the scout. The sharpening that came out of it:
      **don't make them tools, make them code inside the tool** — a tool is
      the model's to skip, a line inside `search()` is not. Only the pasted-id
      regex stayed client-side, and not because the agent couldn't: it is one
      `if` that cannot be wrong, versus a model retyping `2304.01234v2`.

      **Binding filters, everywhere the bar means them.** `year_from` /
      `year_to` / `fields` ride in `ScoutDeps`; the model never sees them and
      has no argument that overrides them, though it may narrow *inside* the
      window (the code takes the narrower of the two bounds). They bind the
      **researcher's** paper searches too — Patrick's addition, and three
      lines once the plumbing existed — because they belong to the bar rather
      than to one of its modes. Deliberately scoped to *discovery*: they never
      touch `expand_node`, since filtering a reference list by year wouldn't
      narrow a search, it would hide real citations and leave the graph lying
      about what cites what. Paths that **cannot** honor a field filter (the
      snapshot cache, `match_title`) switch **off** while one is set rather
      than quietly ignoring it — a filter with a hole in it is worse than no
      filter, because the UI promises it.

      **Streaming, in three passes.** Browser testing drove the whole
      progressive-rendering design, and each pass fixed something real. (1)
      The result landed in one dispatch and the panel sat frozen for the
      several seconds a scout run takes — so `/api/search` became SSE and the
      path was rebuilt to drive the **same reducers a streamed answer walks**
      (`turnStarted` → `traceAdded` → `answerSet` → `paperRefsSet`), adding
      only `answerSet`, because this path's later text *supersedes* its
      earlier text rather than continuing it. (2) Every trace chip read
      *"nothing new"* — including the one that found everything — because
      `ChatMessage` renders that whenever `found` is absent, and the frames
      carried no count; each lookup is now announced twice, pending on issue
      and counted when it lands (the transcript's existing pending-twin
      replacement fills the chip in rather than doubling it). (3) The papers
      still arrived all at once, because the scout finds them a **batch per
      lookup** and the route sat on them until the end — they now ride out
      with each finished chip, so the list grows as the search works. Timing
      probe against the real server: `cached` at 0.01s, chips and papers
      1s apart, `result` at 3.12s.

      **Cache-first, rebuilt on the stream.** The old instant tier needed a
      second endpoint racing the first; on a stream it is just an earlier
      frame. The route emits `cached` before draining the scout, so papers
      already on disk are clickable in milliseconds, marked **⚡ opens
      instantly** where the paper's *own* graph is cached (a precise claim: no
      provider call at all). The scout reads the same cache from inside its
      `search` tool, which is what keeps a rate-limited provider answering.

      **Also shipped alongside:** a **Drop cache** action in the settings
      modal (two-step confirm — a native dialog blocks the page, and the
      warning worth showing is specific: everything here refetches, and *saved
      sessions and the library are untouched*), and the fix for a bug it
      surfaced — `local_search` had been **silently blind since v7.5.0**,
      scanning a key prefix the snapshot cache had versioned out from under
      it. See [docs/bugs.md](bugs.md); the guard is
      `services.graph.snapshot_prefix`, one format with one writer and one
      reader.

- [x] **Phase 2.4 — Cache-first seed search** *(v1.6.0)* — seed-search results
      served from the **local snapshot cache instantly**, before (and independent
      of) the live arXiv search: `/api/local_search` scans cached graph snapshots
      by title/authors, ranks phrase matches → explored seeds → citation count,
      and flags papers whose own neighborhood is freshly cached (an **instant**
      badge — those explore without touching the rate-limited API). Live arXiv
      results append below when they land; if arXiv is unreachable, the cached
      papers still work. Born of a real rate-limited evening.

- [x] **Publication date in search results + seed-search filters** *(v1.16.0)* —
      arXiv hits now show their **publication date** (from the paper's own
      submission day), and the search surface gained an optional **filter
      popover**: a dual-handle **year-range slider** (folds to no-bound at 1991 /
      the current year, so a full-width slider is the no-op state) plus an **arXiv
      category picker** fed by a new `/api/taxonomy` endpoint (server-validated
      codes, any-of match). Filters AND onto arXiv's query (`submittedDate` + `cat`
      clauses) and the local cache's year window alike; an explicit id/URL lookup
      ignores them. This is where the dormant `taxonomy.py` finally earns its keep.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-03.)*
- [x] **Filter popover stays open after Explore** *(v1.18.1)* — the seed-search
      filter popover didn't close when a search fired; `Search`'s form `onSubmit`
      now collapses it (`setOpen(false)`) before running the search.

### Detail panel & paper enrichment

- [x] **TL;DR before the abstract in the detail panel** *(v8.4.0)* — the
      summary section's tabs now read **TL;DR | Abstract**, and the section
      opens on the TL;DR **when one already exists**. The tab order was
      trivial; the default view was the decision. A paper without a TL;DR
      (every OpenAlex paper, plus S2's gaps) gets one from a model call on
      the *first click* of its ✦ tab — the only surface allowed to bill — so
      opening on it would have spent a call on every selection. Such a paper
      still opens on its abstract. The view is now the reader's pick *or
      null*, and null derives from the node, so a TL;DR that arrives with
      hydration takes over the section it was missing from, while a tab the
      reader chose sticks. The tour's stop became *"TL;DR & abstract"* to
      teach the new order. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-10-02;
      browser-tested and approved by Patrick, 2026-10-03.)*

- [x] **General non-arXiv full text — and figures** *(v5.27.0)* — papers
      without an ar5iv render (journal papers, failed LaTeX conversions) now
      get **full text and figures mined from their open-access PDF**. The
      ticket's original scope was "S2's `openAccessPdf` + the existing pymupdf
      pipeline as a fallback reader for `read_paper` (text only; figures stay
      ar5iv-quality-or-nothing)" — it shipped considerably wider on Patrick's
      call: **both providers** resolve the OA URL (S2 `openAccessPdf` — added
      to `DETAIL_FIELDS`; OpenAlex location `pdf_url`s, which in practice know
      OA copies S2's records miss — both surfaced as the node shape's new
      `oa_pdf` field), and a caption-anchored extractor
      (**`services/pdf`**, new package) mines **figures, tables, AND algorithm
      boxes** from the PDF for the detail panel's figure strip, the
      researcher's `show_figure`, and a real **PDF ↗ link for journal papers**
      in the panel actions. Extraction is caption-first (spiked on JMLR-LDA /
      Attention / PPO: 33 of 35 real floats with correct captions): `Figure N:`
      regions grow from image rects + vector-drawing clusters with
      subfigure/film-strip chaining, `Table N:` via `find_tables` → same-width
      booktabs **rule spans** → widened drawing skeletons, `Algorithm N`
      between its bounding rules (which doubles as the in-prose-mention
      filter; the `[:.]` in the caption regex kills "Figure 2 provides…"
      false positives). Mined floats are served as on-demand page-region
      renders (`/api/pdf_figure/<token>/<n>`, opaque server-minted tokens — no
      open proxy) with nothing pixel-cached server-side; the PDF itself is the
      cache (`data/oa_pdfs/`, LRU-capped) with text + figure manifest memoized
      in SQLite — design rationale written up in **`docs/pdf-mining.md`**.
      Known limitation: floats made purely of text (no image/drawing/rule
      anywhere, e.g. blei03a's Figure 6) have no geometric anchor and are
      skipped. New `config.pdf` section (size cap, timeout, cache size, float
      cap, render dpi); verified live end-to-end on the PLOS "Why Most
      Published Research Findings Are False" PDF via OpenAlex resolution.
- [x] **Phase 2.1 — Sidebar enrichment** *(v1.2.0)* — under the detail panel's
      TL;DR, the paper's **own figures with their captions** (`figures.py`
      extracts them from **ar5iv** HTML, cached 30 days; images streamed through
      a same-origin `/api/figure_proxy` locked to the ar5iv host — no hotlink
      reliance, no open proxy; tables skipped; graceful fallback where ar5iv has
      no render), plus a **direct PDF link** beside the arXiv-abstract link.
      Shipped alongside a UI polish: the year filter is now a single
      **dual-thumb range slider** (two overlaid inputs on one track + fill)
      instead of two stacked sliders.
- [x] **Detail-panel arXiv category tags** *(v2.3.0)* — the panel now shows an
      arXiv paper's own category tags (`cs.LG` → "Machine Learning") as
      read-only pills between the meta line and the TL;DR. S2 doesn't carry
      per-paper categories, so a new `integrations.arxiv.categories` module
      hits arXiv's own export API (a different host from ar5iv) for the raw
      codes and labels them via a new `vocab.name_for` lookup, served by
      `GET /api/paper/<ref>/categories` (same degrade-to-`available:false`
      contract as figures/code) and fetched lazily in `useSelection` alongside
      them. *Fixed same day:* six pairs in the taxonomy are different codes
      that happen to share one display name (`cs.LG`/`stat.ML`, both
      "Machine Learning"; also the `cs.IT`/`math.IT`, `cs.NA`/`math.NA`,
      `cs.SY`/`eess.SY`, `math.MP`/`math-ph`, `math.ST`/`stat.TH` pairs) — a
      paper cross-listed in both of a pair showed the identical label twice
      (caught on Kingma & Welling's VAE paper, tagged both `stat.ML` and
      `cs.LG`); `get_categories` now dedupes by display name, keeping arXiv's
      first-listed code of the pair. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-07.)*
- [x] **Papers-with-code / implementation links** *(v1.23.0)* — the detail panel
      now shows a **"Code & artifacts"** section from **Hugging Face Papers**
      (Papers with Code's successor): the community-linked **GitHub repo** (with
      stars) plus the top linked **models / datasets / Spaces** and their full
      counts, linking out to the paper's HF page. One call to
      `huggingface.co/api/papers/{arxiv_id}` (`integrations/huggingface.py`),
      day-cached in SQLite (misses too), served by `GET /api/paper/<id>/code`,
      which degrades to `available: false` on any HF failure — never 500s the
      panel. Lazily fetched per paper alongside figures; the actions row was
      restyled to fit (compact Abstract/PDF/Pin chips, full-width Explore).
      *Not done (needs one HF call per node, no batch endpoint): flagging graph
      nodes that have code.*
- [x] **Zoom on detail-panel figures** *(v2.4.0)* — the sidebar's paper figures
      (Phase 2.1) are now click-to-enlarge, reusing the same **lightbox** the
      answer figures got in v1.20.0. Since it's now a genuine two-consumer
      component, `Lightbox.tsx` was promoted out of `teacher/figures/` to a
      new root-level `figures/` folder per the hybrid structure rule (each
      caller — `Teacher.tsx`, `graph/GraphExplorer.tsx` — still owns its own
      open/close state and instance). Caught a latent bug in the move: the
      caption line unconditionally rendered `Figure {figure.figure}`, fine
      for the teacher's always-numbered agent-cited figures but a bare
      "Figure " for the detail panel's un-numbered ones — now the label only
      shows when a number actually exists. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-04.)*
- [x] **S2 categories as detail-panel tags** *(v2.6.0)* — alongside the v2.3.0
      arXiv category pills, the detail panel now surfaces Semantic Scholar's own
      field-of-study classification (`s2FieldsOfStudy`, falling back to the
      coarser `fieldsOfStudy`) as tags. Rendered as **two provider-labeled
      sections** (styled like "Code & artifacts") — an **arXiv tags** section
      and a **Semantic Scholar tags** section (accent-tinted) — so it's clear
      who tagged what; a non-arXiv paper shows the S2 section alone. No new
      endpoint: S2 already returns these on the paper object, so the fields ride
      along with the existing detail hydration (`DETAIL_FIELDS`) — light on
      graph neighbors, filled in on click like the abstract/TL;DR. The normalized
      node gained a `fields_of_study` list (deduped, order-preserving), defaulted
      on the `Node` model so snapshots cached before it still validate.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-07.)*
- [x] **Proper subscripts & math notation** *(v3.2.0)* — paper text surfaces
      (titles, abstracts, TL;DRs, lecture beats, answers, search hits, figure
      captions) now render **delimited LaTeX** (`$…$`, `$$…$$`, `\(…\)`,
      `\[…\]`) with **KaTeX**, via a shared `frontend/src/notation/` package:
      `<MathText>` for the DOM surfaces, `latexToUnicode` for graph node labels
      (canvas — KaTeX can't reach it, so β₂ is a best-effort Unicode
      approximation). Scoped to *delimited* math only — bare "CO2"/"H2O" is left
      alone (auto-subscripting digits misfires on "GPT4", "COVID19"). Shipping
      it surfaced a backend bug: ar5iv figure captions arrived as tripled MathML
      soup (`subscriptitalic-ϵ…`); the fix emits each `<math>`'s clean `alttext`
      LaTeX instead — see [Bugs](bugs.md). Deferred to a later ticket:
      user-uploaded source titles and researcher trace chips.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-08; shipped 2026-07-08.)*

### AI teacher & lectures

- [x] **The scope is for the turn: rings while the agent works, nothing
      after — and a paperless beat keeps its colour** *(v7.28.0)* — the last
      two of Patrick's 2026-09-17 round.

      **The closing beat looked disabled.** `BeatList` dimmed any beat with
      no `node_ids` under a `.stale` class written for a beat whose papers
      had *left the graph* — a check that no longer existed, so the only
      beat it ever hit was the synthesis that closes most lectures, the one
      paragraph tying the rest together. Now `.paperless`: full colour, no
      pointer, no hover, no click, because it has nothing to light.

      **"I can't remember why we leave the scoping."** The record: Codex's
      review (2026-09-15) proposed releasing the message scope at the turn's
      end *back to the prior manual selection*, and Patrick overruled it —
      *"it should change permanently and not revert back to the user's
      manual scope"* (v7.24.0). What he asked for now is a third thing, and
      consistent with that objection: *"It should only scope at the
      beginning … to show the user what nodes are in scope for this request.
      By the end of the agent's response, the scoping (blue rings) should go
      away and reset to nothing."* Clearing is not reverting. So both stream
      endings (`ask`, `lectureInChat`) dispatch `nodeSelectionCleared` on the
      on-screen thread once the answer lands, after the highlight — the
      rings show what the turn was about while it runs, then go; the cited
      or narrated papers stay lit. On failure too: a retry re-resolves the
      stamped request, so nothing depends on the rings surviving. The
      consequence flagged and accepted: a hand-picked selection is consumed
      by the turn it grounds. `scope/README.md` carries both decisions.
      *(Browser-tested and approved by Patrick, 2026-09-17.)*

- [x] **"Lecture on it instead" on a router-chosen answer** *(v7.27.0)* —
      the transcript had rendered the offer in both directions since the
      router shipped, and `reroute` handled both — but only `lectureInChat`
      stamped its turn as routed; `ask` never did, so an answer the model
      chose over a lecture showed no line and no offer. Patrick, 2026-09-17,
      after v7.26.0: *"I would also like to answer as a lecture if the
      router chooses an answer instead."* Then, on reflection: *"just add
      the missing piece of stamping its turn in the ask(); that should be
      sufficient. We don't need to get cute beyond that."* So `ask` takes the
      same `routed` flag as its mirror, set only from the router's path —
      which draws the line he'd raised ("not all kinds of questions should
      be able to transform to lectures") where the code already draws it:
      the router only runs with a graph on screen, so graph-free library
      questions, retries and corrections carry no offer. A finer line (the
      router flagging whether a lecture was *plausible*) was considered and
      declined as not worth the extra field. One more from the browser
      round: the corrected turn opened **below the fold** — the transcript's
      follow-scroll only chases the bottom while the reader is already
      there, and a reroute is clicked on an older turn, from further up. A
      send from the bar had the same gap. Starting a turn now re-arms the
      follow (`followNextTurn`), so the new turn's first frame scrolls into
      view; scrolling up mid-answer is still respected. *(Browser-tested and
      approved by Patrick, 2026-09-17.)*

- [x] **Scope contract, part (b): the whole graph by name, and a period that
      binds discovery** *(v7.25.0)* — the two pieces of Codex's v7.24.0 review
      deliberately left for a second step. **`graph`** is a sixth scope kind
      the router reads off "the whole graph", "everything on the map", "all
      the papers in this graph" (live: all three → `graph`; "lecture me on
      everything" stays the deictic `screen`, via the fast path): everything
      the workspace holds, past every filter, selected like any message
      scope. It is the condition the review set for keeping *visible* as the
      default — the lot is one sentence away, not a filter-reset away. And
      **`filtersForTurn`** folds a message's period into the researcher's
      discovery filters — the same `year_from`/`year_to` wire fields the ▽
      filters use, the stricter side of each — so "what did the citations
      from the last three years find?" no longer grounds in the right papers
      and then pulls in a 2015 discovery. Discovery only, like the ▽ filters
      themselves: `expand_node` walks citations somebody actually wrote, and
      the v6-era reasoning in `ResearcherDeps` (filtering a reference list by
      year hides real edges) stands. *(Filed 2026-09-15 while shipping
      v7.24.0; shipped 2026-09-15.)*

- [x] **One scope rule for both agents: message → selection → visible**
      *(v7.24.0)* — Patrick, the day after v7.23.0 shipped: *"now that we
      have changed the scoping to whatever the user asks about in their
      context or whatever is manually scoped by the user, the filters in the
      graph controls should no longer affect the scope"* — and, on reflection,
      *"maybe the filters is what the agent ultimately defaults on if the
      first 2 options fail. However, this needs to be coded in the agent's
      workflow — right? I don't believe we have a priority list like this
      anywhere? … I was worried that these different scoping features could
      overlap in destructive and unintended ways."* They did. The order
      existed, but only as the emergent behaviour of three pieces of code
      (`useConversation.send`'s message scope, the workspace's `scopedNodes`
      — selection ∩ visible, else visible — and the view filter feeding it),
      and reading them together found two destructive overlaps and a gap: a
      message scope *replaced* a hand-picked selection and released it to
      nothing; the filters silently beat the selection (a selected paper a
      later slider change hid dropped out of scope with no signal); and only
      lectures got message scoping — the router's `scope` was ignored on a
      question. *(From Patrick, 2026-09-15; design reviewed by Codex the same
      day; shipped 2026-09-15.)*

      **The rule is one function now.** `frontend/src/scope/resolve.ts`,
      `resolveScope`: what the **message** asked for, else the reader's
      **hand-picked selection**, else what is **visible** — with "visible"
      defined as *passes the view filters*, independent of the viewport and
      of what else the canvas draws. `selectScope` replaces
      `selectGroundingNodes`/`selectLectureNodes`; the researcher and the
      lecturer get the same snapshot. Codex's review kept **visible as the
      default** ("filters give users a way to establish context; defaulting
      to the whole graph would weaken that control" — "the whole graph" is to
      be an explicit scope, planned with the researcher's tool constraints)
      and tightened four parts, three of which shipped as stated:

      - **Absent ≠ empty.** An explicit ask that matches nothing is the
        empty-scope signal — `{source: 'message', nodes: []}` — and fails the
        turn in words for either agent (*"None of the papers you named are
        on this graph…"*, *"This graph has no references from 1990–1999."*),
        never falling through to the selection or the visible papers, and
        leaving the selection as it was.
      - **Eligibility is not rendering.** `GraphExplorer` now publishes the
        *filter-passing* set as `visibleNodeIds` and separately draws every
        scoped paper the filters would hide (`ghosts`, with a dotted outer
        ring and a legend entry, *"In scope, hidden by your filters"*). This
        also caught a v7.23.0 bug: the drawn set was being published, so a
        revealed paper leaked into the default scope of the next question.
        The stored `revealedNodeIds` is gone — a scoped-but-hidden paper is
        drawn *because* it is selected, derived rather than stored.
      - **Resolve once per turn.** `send` resolves, stamps `ChatMsg.scope`
        (source, request, count — shown as *"Scoped to the references,
        2010–2019 · 12 papers"* / *"Scoped to your 5 selected papers"*,
        nothing for the visible default), and hands the same `ResolvedScope`
        to `ask` or `lectureInChat`, which never read the store for it again.
        A correction or retry re-resolves the *stamped request* against the
        graph as it stands then.

      **The fourth was Patrick's to overrule, and he did.** The review
      proposed message scope as an override layer released at the turn's
      end, exposing the prior selection. Built that way, tested, and
      reversed on the browser pass: *"if the scope changes for a user's
      request, it should change permanently and not revert back to the user's
      manual scope. To me, the turn should just end with the scope of the
      turn."* So a message scope **becomes the selection** (`send` dispatches
      `nodeSelectionSet`) and stays, exactly as if the reader had marqueed
      it — which also deleted the override state, its two actions, its ring
      selector and its thread-activation cleanup: the selection *is* the
      scope, whoever set it, and Esc clears it either way. (This supersedes
      v7.23.0's "one-shot" release, which Patrick had asked for a day
      earlier; the earlier ask was about not leaving a *stale* scope behind,
      and a scope that is the selection is not stale.)

      **Selection beats filters.** A picked paper a slider later hides stays
      in scope and stays drawn, dotted. The controls readout lost its
      denominator (`N papers selected`, not `N / shown`) because the shown
      count could now be smaller than the selection. **Discoveries are
      papers**: in scope on the same terms as any other (eligible, selected
      or named); the researcher's "keep every discovery regardless" special
      case went. **Questions scope too**: the router prompt reads scope and
      period for an `answer` exactly as for a lecture — live probe: *"what
      do the references say about entropy?"* → references, *"who wrote the
      seed paper?"* → seed, *"what does Hawking 1975 argue?"* → named,
      *"which of these used dropout?"* → screen — with `screen` as the
      tie-break, keeping the context the reader already set up.

      **One reversal from v7.23.0 in the resolver:** a *bare* period ("the
      papers between 2016 and 2017") narrows the reader's existing context
      (selection, else visible) instead of reaching past the year slider —
      per the review's "an ambiguous ask preserves the existing context"; a
      year outside the slider gets *"…widen the year filter, or say which
      papers."* A period *with* a kind ("the references from the 2010s")
      still reads off the whole graph. Filed for (b): the researcher's
      search/expand honouring the turn's year window, and the explicit
      `graph` scope.

- [x] **A lecture request says which papers — and `/lecture` is gone**
      *(v7.23.0)* — Patrick's ask, 2026-09-15: *"I think we can probably
      remove the /lecture command. It's not really needed if the orchestration
      router can already infer how to answer the user's question on its own. I
      also would like the lecture agent to be able to infer from the user's
      context which nodes it should focus on … if the user mentions a specific
      set of nodes such as 'references' or 'citations' or 'this paper: <paper
      name>' or 'these papers: <paper1>, <paper2>, …'. If, for whatever
      reason, those nodes are currently filtered out on screen, the agent
      could somehow make them pop on screen by force. Perhaps the scoping
      should only be implicit if the user doesn't add context to their
      request?"* — and, mid-test, *"can you summarize the papers between
      2016-2017?"*.

      **The command went first, and it went because of the second half.**
      `/lecture history` was the deterministic path: destination and framing
      named outright, no classify, nothing to correct. But a two-value command
      has no way to spell *"on the references"* — and once the router reads
      scope off the words, it reads target and framing too, so the command
      was a second, narrower spelling of the same thing. `frontend/src/commands/`
      (parse, menu engine, menu, CSS, tests) is deleted; the composer, its
      placeholder (*"Ask about these papers, or for a lecture…"*), the
      empty-chat hint, the tour's lecture step and the README teach asking in
      words. What survives of the deterministic path is the router's own
      no-model fast path — and it got **narrower**, not wider: `OBVIOUS_LECTURE`
      still claims "lecture me on these", but a new `DEICTIC_TAIL` whitelist
      lets it keep a match only when the tail points at the screen ("these",
      "the selected papers", "how we got here"). "Lecture me on the
      references" now goes to the model, because the scope is the half a
      regex cannot read — and a keyword pattern that gets "the references"
      right and "the papers that reference the seed" wrong is the guessing
      fast path the v7.20.0 design ruled out. The negative tests grew by one
      block: every lecture request that says which papers is pinned as *not*
      claimed.

      **The router returns three things now, plus a period.** `MessageRoute`
      gained `scope` — `screen` (the message didn't say: the reader's own
      on-screen scope, every lecture before this and still the common case),
      `references`, `citations`, `seed`, or `named` (the message pointed at
      specific papers) — and `year_from`/`year_to`, a window that *combines*
      with any scope ("the references from the 2010s") rather than being a
      sixth kind; the message goes out with today's date appended so "the
      last five years" has something to count back from. `named` is a
      promise, not an answer: the classifier reads the message alone, and a
      **second, separate call** — `resolve_papers` behind `POST
      /api/route/papers` — is shown the graph's papers as `[n] title (first
      author, year)` and returns indices. Separate so the paper list crosses
      the wire and is billed only for the one message in many that names a
      paper, never on the every-message classify; thin (`RoutePaper`: id,
      title, year, authors — no abstract) because a title, an author and a
      year are what a reader names a paper *by*. Both calls keep the v7.20.0
      failure contract — never raise, never None; an empty `ids` is both
      "nothing matched" and every failure, since the client handles the first
      anyway. Live probe on `claude-haiku-4-5`: every phrasing routed right
      ("this paper: Particle creation by black holes" → named; "lecture me on
      transformers" → screen, a topic is not a paper); the resolver found "the
      Bekenstein paper", "Hawking 1975" and "Hawking's papers", and declined
      "transformers" after one prompt tightening. The framing rule was
      tightened in the same pass — `history` **only** when asked for the
      story — after "the papers that cite this one" drifted to history for no
      reason. Cost: ~0.9–1.1s per classify, up from ~780ms; the longer prompt.

      **The frontend decides what a scope means *on this graph*, because
      only it knows what is on screen.** `teacher/lectureScope.ts`: "the
      references" are the reference-tagged nodes — the tag the paper is
      *coloured* by and the set its chip toggles, so the word means the same
      said as clicked (a satellite's references count, per the v7.17.0 rule
      that what the reader put on screen is narrated); "the seed" is the solo
      lecture by name; a period filters off the **whole** graph, not the
      visible part — a year the sliders exclude is exactly the case the
      message should reach past, like a hidden relation — narrowed within a
      hand-picked selection when there is one, and never admitting an undated
      paper (placing one in a period is a claim we cannot make). Then the
      scope goes on the canvas *before* the lecture starts: `lectureScopeApplied`
      makes it the hand-picked selection and **reveals** the hidden ones — a
      new `revealedNodeIds` the view filter exempts from chips, sliders and
      caps, with a revealed paper's edges surviving their chip being off (or it
      would float unattached). The chips deliberately stay as the reader set
      them: the message overrode the view for these papers, it did not edit
      their controls. And `send` hands the same nodes to `lectureInChat`
      explicitly rather than reading the store back, because the canvas
      republishes its visible set on its *next* render and the lecture starts
      before that — reading `selectLectureNodes` would narrate the scope the
      message had just replaced. A scope that matches nothing on the graph
      **fails the turn in words** (*"None of the papers you named are on this
      graph — @-mention one to open it…"*, *"This graph has no references from
      1990–1999 to lecture on."*) rather than lecturing on everything: the
      reader asked for a paper, and silence about not finding it would be the
      app deciding it knew better — the override this app keeps having to
      remove.

      **The scope is one-shot** — Patrick, on the first browser pass: *"I led
      you astray here: while I want the user's initial request to force scope,
      once the lecture finishes, it should only be highlighting the nodes. The
      scope should be reset."* So the selection holds while the lecture streams
      (papers ringed, the rest dimmed, "Scoped to N papers" in the panel) and
      `lectureScopeReleased` lets it go when the stream ends — unless the
      reader re-picked meanwhile, in which case their pick stands. What stays is
      the highlight: **every** lecture, scoped or not, now ends with all of its
      beats' papers lit and its bubble active, where before only the last beat
      stayed lit, which read as the lecture pointing at its ending rather than
      at what it covered. The revealed papers stay on screen too (a released
      reveal would hide the very papers the highlight is lighting) until the
      next Esc — so the reveal outlives the selection it came with, and the
      store README says why.

      **And the lecture bubble is a control.** A lecture turn has no `cited`
      list — its papers live on its beats — so it was the one assistant turn
      whose bubble did nothing when clicked. It now lights every beat's papers
      at once, deduped (a beat still lights its own), which is also the state
      a lecture ends in. Patrick, same pass: *"I should be able to click on the
      lecture background box and re-highlight all the nodes on screen related
      to the full lecture."*

      Filed alongside, not shipped: the "Lecture it instead" correction still
      hard-codes `summary` — see the Backlog. *(From Patrick, 2026-09-15;
      shipped 2026-09-15.)*

- [x] **Lecture turns never reach the researcher as history** *(v7.22.0)* — v7.21.0
      dropped the `lectures` wire field on the grounds that a lecture is a chat
      turn now and *"reaches the agent as ordinary history like any other
      turn"* (`useConversation.ts:444-450`, `routes/agents.py:330-334`). It
      doesn't. Three things line up to make the comment false:

      - `/api/lecture` calls `_relay(...)` with **no `store`**
        (`routes/agents.py:268`), so a lecture is never written to
        `_QA_SESSIONS`.
      - An ordinary `ask()` sends **`history: undefined`**
        (`useConversation.ts:701,718`); only `retryAnswer` sends the client
        transcript, and `_resumed_history` uses it *only when the server has
        nothing* (`routes/agents.py:300`).
      - Even the client path would drop lectures: `chatBeatAdded` pushes onto
        `msg.beats` and leaves `text` empty (`store/transcript.ts:507`), and
        the history builder filters on `turn.text.trim()`
        (`useConversation.ts:777`).

      So a reader who asks for a lecture and then *"why did they abandon
      that approach?"* gets an answer from a researcher that never saw the
      lecture — the exact regression the old `lectures` field existed to
      prevent. A second smell in the same place: `_QA_SESSIONS` vs
      `_SOURCES_SESSIONS` (`routes/agents.py:54-55`) split history **by
      endpoint**, so a graph-free turn and a graph turn under the same session
      id can't see each other either.

      **Fix — make the client own history.** The transcript is already the
      persisted truth (it survives a reload; the in-memory server dicts
      don't), and `_resumed_history` already validates and caps a client copy.
      So: always send `history`, built by one `toHistoryTurn(msg)` that joins
      beat prose for lecture turns, skips `unfinished` turns and strips
      `<<FIG n>>` markers the way `_relay` does today; then delete both server
      dicts and the "server copy wins" branch. The module docstring's *locked
      decision* — agents receive history, they never store it — is honoured
      better by this than by route-level dicts. Test it with a lecture turn
      followed by a question and assert the lecture prose is in what
      `researcher.answer` receives. Patch-sized, and a prerequisite for the
      *Threads* ticket (Larger phases), where history = the thread's chat.
      *(Found in the 2026-09-14 design pass; Codex flagged it, verified
      against the code the same day.)*


- [x] **One chat interface: the Lecture UI is gone and a lecture is a command**
      *(v7.21.0)* — the philosophy was Patrick's: everything the assistant does
      should be reachable from the one bar you type into. *"Should we remove the
      lecture buttons and integrate everything into one chat?… Or if there was
      a better design, we could go with that instead."* v7.20.0 got the
      lecturer *into* the chat; this took the parallel interface back out.
      *(From Patrick, 2026-09-13.)*

      **What the reader sees.** Type `/` and a menu opens on `/lecture`, with
      `summary` and `history` as its second word. The lecture arrives as a reply
      in the conversation, behind its own caret — open when it lands, folding
      itself when the next one arrives. The panel is one thing now: the
      conversation, with the 📚 source scope beneath the bar and ▽ filters back
      inside it.

      **`/` rather than `!`, and with a typeahead rather than bare syntax.**
      Patrick proposed `!lecture summary`; `/` won because the composer already
      owns `@` and every other app puts a command menu behind `/` (Claude Code,
      Slack, Discord, Notion), so the two read as siblings where `!` would be a
      third convention in one text box. The menu is not decoration: a command
      syntax nobody is shown is a hidden feature, and with the Lecture section's
      explanatory paragraph deleted, the menu's one-line hints are where a
      reader now learns lectures exist at all. Built on `mentions/`'s shape
      (parse the token at the caret, rank, hold a keyboard selection, insert on
      Enter) minus the network half — the list is static, so no debounce, no
      abort, no out-of-order results, and the selection is tracked by index
      rather than by id.

      **The prefix is safe because a command is anchored to the start of the
      message.** An `@`-mention is a reference *inside* a sentence; a command is
      what the message *is*. That one rule is why `2/3`, `9/13`, `p/q` and
      `https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762` cannot open the menu, and the negative
      tests pinning it are the valuable half of `commands/parse.test.ts`.
      `readCommand` is strict for the same reason: the name must match exactly
      and what follows must be empty or one of the command's own values, so
      `/lecture on transformers` is *not* a command and falls through to the
      v7.20.0 router, which reads it as words and sends it to the lecturer
      anyway. Degrading beats the alternatives — silently dropping words the
      reader typed, or inventing a topic argument the lecturer cannot honour
      (it narrates the scoped graph, and a topic is not a scope).

      **But the prize was the state machine, not the button.** A lecture used
      to be a *slot*: `conversation.lecture` plus `lectureShown`, written by a
      three-way show/hide/generate toggle (`toggleLecture`), cleared by its own
      section-level `clearLecture`, streamed on its own `lectureCtrl` so it ran
      in parallel with the chat, and fed to the researcher through a 🎓 picker
      that asked whether it counted as context — which in turn needed a
      `lectures` field on `POST /api/ask`, a `_lectures_context` prompt block
      with its own char budget in the researcher, and `agents/models.py`
      (`PlayedLecture`/`PlayedBeat`), a module that existed for nothing else.
      **Every piece of that existed because a lecture came from a button and so
      had nowhere in the conversation to live.** It has somewhere now
      (`ChatMsg.beats`), and all of it is deleted: one controller, one clear,
      one code path, and a lecture reaching the researcher as ordinary history.
      Net **~900 lines removed**.

      That also dissolved a filed ticket — "a lecture that grounded an answer
      should say so in the provenance line", whose stated difficulty was that
      every other count on that line is an *observed* tool call while lecture
      context was *pushed* into the prompt and so uncountable. The awkwardness
      was an artifact of the push, not of lectures.

      **Two behaviours were deliberately reversed.** A graph load used to
      **drop** the exploration's lecture, on the reasoning that a lecture
      belongs to the graph whose nodes its beats point at; a lecture is a turn
      now, and deleting half a transcript on a graph load would be the
      conversation rewriting itself, so it stays. And the **panel's folding
      sections went too** (Patrick, mid-branch): deleting the Lecture half left
      a lone "CHAT" caret folding away the only thing in a panel already titled
      "AI Teacher & Discovery", with a ✕ beside it doing that job more honestly.
      With no row above them the ask-binding controls have one home each rather
      than one per panel shape — and ▽ filters went back *inside* the pill
      (Patrick's call), which v7.11.0 had emptied of four controls: two of those
      four are gone since, so there was room for the one that binds the question
      most directly.

      **A turn now says which graph it came from, and that is a control.** Since
      v7.10.0 a graph load keeps the conversation, so one transcript can hold
      turns about several graphs. Everything already handled that *negatively* —
      a stale `[n]` greys out, a bubble stops being clickable, and beat cards
      joined them here (see [docs/bugs.md](bugs.md)) — but every one of those
      signals says *this points nowhere any more* and never *this was about the
      AlphaZero graph*. So `turnGraphSet` stamps each turn with its seed, its
      paper count and its provider, and a turn from a graph other than the one
      on screen renders *"From the “…” graph"* — wearing the same three-node
      glyph a seeding citation chip wears, and re-opening that graph when
      clicked. **Conditional on purpose:** when the graph matches, the reader is
      looking at it and the line would be noise; what earns it is the
      discrimination. The provider is stored because a node id means nothing
      outside its own backend's id space, so the click had to carry one.
      Lectures also gained the grounding line they never had — *"narrated 14
      papers"* — because `provenance` counts tool calls and a lecture makes
      none.

      **Restore folds three eras of save into the transcript**
      (`restoredLectureTurn`): a v7.17.0-era single `lecture`, a v6-era
      per-mode `lectures` cache (picking the mode that was on screen), and an
      ancient flat `beats` array. Folding rather than ignoring is the point —
      the destination slot is gone, so a restore that did nothing would
      silently discard the reader's lecture. The turn carries no invented
      question: a button lecture was never asked for in words, and a fabricated
      `/lecture summary` would claim a framing the save does not record.

      **Also deleted, because the UI that read them went:**
      `selectSatelliteCount` (which fed the intro paragraph's "that includes
      the 3 papers you expanded" — its reasoning is kept in
      `store/README.md`, since it applies again the moment anything wants to
      say what a lecture leaves out) and ~180 lines of section/lecture CSS.
      Help surfaces moved with all of it: the tour's lecture stop and 🎓-scope
      stop are gone, the ask bar carries two stops instead (what the researcher
      does, and how `/lecture` reaches the lecturer), and the placeholder now
      names at most one prefix — a verb plus two prefixes read as a legend
      rather than an invitation.

- [x] **The chat bar decides what a message is** *(v7.20.0)* — the ask was for
      the composer to reach both assistants: *"should we remove the lecture
      buttons and integrate everything into one chat? The lecture agent can
      still exist of course, but perhaps we just invoke it in the main chat by
      leveraging the orchestration agent that reads the user's prompt and
      figures out if it's a lecture request or general question. A prompt like
      'Summarize xyz' or 'Lecture me about...' would invoke the lecture agent
      and render the beats in the chat."* *(From Patrick, 2026-09-08; scope
      narrowed by what shipped in v7.17.0, which deleted the four-button mode
      grid the ticket was written to remove and left strictly the routing —
      plus one thing it created: the composer has to infer **framing**, summary
      vs history, where the button row has the reader state it.)*

      **This is the router coming back, and it is a different component than
      the one v7.0.0 deleted.** That router was an `Intent` enum round-trip
      between a route and the function next to it, dispatching two known
      intents to two agents, and it died because it "never grew the model half
      it was designed around" (see `agents/orchestrators/README.md`, *"The
      router that isn't here"*). This is that model half, finally wanted — so
      it rebuilt as **an agent that classifies**, with one caller and a typed
      decision, not as a funnel every route passes through.

      **Two stages, and the cheap one runs first.** `OBVIOUS_LECTURE` is a
      deliberately narrow regex over phrasings that *name* a lecture outright
      ("lecture me on…", "give me a lecture on…", "lecture:") — free, instant,
      and the same short-circuit `ID_RE` already does for a pasted id. It is
      narrow on purpose: the negative tests are the valuable half, pinning the
      phrasings it must **not** claim (`summarize this`, `walk me through
      attention`, `teach me about transformers`, `what did the lecture say
      about ResNet?`). Everything else goes to the model, which earns the call
      on exactly the distinction no pattern gets right: *"summarize this"* is a
      question about the open paper, *"summarize these papers for me"* is a
      lecture, and *"what's the story here?"* is a lecture framed as **history**.

      **And the classify is skipped whenever a lecture is impossible** — no
      graph, or nothing visible to lecture about. Not an optimization: there is
      no second destination to choose, so paying for the choice would spend the
      reader's latency on a foregone conclusion.

      **The measured cost, which was worse than estimated.** The proposal said
      "a few hundred milliseconds"; fourteen real phrasings on
      `claude-haiku-4-5` measured **580–1040ms, median ~780ms**. A few percent
      of a researcher turn, but paid on every question the fast path doesn't
      catch. Three things make it affordable, and all three are load-bearing:
      the skip above, `Stop` reaching the in-flight classify through its own
      `routeCtrl` (a message stopped while still being routed has no turn yet,
      so aborting the stream is not enough), and the correction below.

      **The route is visible and correctable, per the ticket's own condition.**
      Every routed turn carries a quiet line — *"Answered as a lecture"* —
      and an offer of the other assistant: *"Answer it instead"*. Taking it
      re-asks the same question there and **appends**, rather than replacing:
      the reader may want both, and a transcript that rewrites itself is worse
      than one that grows. The corrected turn carries no offer back, which
      would be an invitation to ping-pong between two answers already on
      screen. A lecture from the **button** carries no line at all — there was
      no guess to undo.

      **Where a chat lecture renders was the one real design fork.** The cheap
      answer was to route into the panel's existing single lecture slot, which
      would have made routing a remote control for a visible button. Instead
      beats land **on the turn** (`ChatMsg.beats`, with `routedTo`), so several
      typed lectures coexist in one conversation, each keeps its own beats and
      its own clickable grounding, and the button's lecture is untouched by one
      streaming beside it. `chatBeatAdded`/`turnRouted` take a conversation key
      like every other transcript action, so a stream writes into the
      exploration that started it.

      **Two smaller decisions worth keeping.** `POST /api/route` is plain
      JSON, not SSE — it is a *decision*, and two round trips (route, then the
      existing stream) beat a combined endpoint that would need a second
      implementation of both workflows' event relays. And the router has **no
      Agent Settings row**: it imports the summarizer's `AGENT_ID`, the fourth
      micro-agent to run on the crew's cheapest model, so nothing had to change
      in `config.json` or its template — and nothing to sync between machines.
      Its `MessageRoute` also deliberately has no `confident` field, unlike
      `PaperName`: there is no throw-it-away branch, because answering *is* the
      fallback. The prompt states the asymmetry outright — a question misrouted
      to the lecturer costs a minute of irrelevant narration, a lecture
      misrouted to the researcher costs one short answer — and `route()` never
      raises and never returns None.

      Help surfaces moved with it (per CLAUDE.md): the tour's lecture step now
      says you can just ask, its ask step teaches the one-click correction, and
      the placeholder reads *"Ask about these papers, or for a lecture… or @ a
      paper"*.

**v7.22.0 follow-up:** the v7.10.0 policy of keeping a single conversation
across graph loads is deliberately reversed by graph-owned threads. Continuity
now lives in the parent exploration; switching graphs resumes its own transcript.

- [x] **The assistant panel becomes folding sections** *(v7.10.0)* — the
      ticket was narrow: *"the lecture-mode buttons sit permanently expanded
      above the chat, taking prime vertical space next to the thing the reader
      actually types into. Fold them into a collapsible section with a little
      caret to expand. Two things to get right: the **default state**
      (collapsed is the point, but a first-time reader must still discover
      lectures exist — the tour teaches them, so check `tour/steps.ts` still
      lands on a visible target), and the **animation**, which should reuse the
      chat surface's existing motion vocabulary (`--ease-rise`/`--ease-fade`,
      and honouring `prefers-reduced-motion`) rather than inventing a third
      easing."* *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-15.)*

      **It grew into the panel's structure**, on Patrick's direction mid-branch:
      if the lectures are a section, so is the conversation. The docked panel
      is now a stack of two — **Lectures** (the four buttons, the intro, and
      whichever lecture is shown) and **Chat** (the conversation, its caret row
      carrying the 🎓/📚 scopes) — under a title row holding only the title and
      the ✕. Lectures starts folded, Chat starts open; both are initial values
      only, so a reader's choice survives the session.

      **What the split bought, beyond the space.** The two used to share one
      scroll and take turns: playing a lecture hid the chat, and `ask`
      dispatched `lectureHidden` so a question hid the lecture. That dispatch
      is gone — you can keep a lecture open and ask about it, which was
      impossible before. Clear split with it: one contextual button could no
      longer say which of the two it would wipe, so `clearLecture` sits on the
      Lectures row and `clearChat` is the bin in the composer.

      **Details worth keeping.** The tour stages both sections open
      (`stagedOpen`, the contract `GraphControls` already had) and its walk
      re-sequenced to the panel's new order — lectures, then the two scopes,
      then the ask bar. Each header reports its own work with the app's shared
      `.spin` rather than `HopDots`: the hopping dots are a *voice* ("an agent
      is composing"), a header is a status line — the same distinction the
      trace chips draw. And the headers are **pinned** (`position: sticky`),
      because a long conversation buried its own header: folding the chat away
      or reaching its scopes meant scrolling back to the top first. That fix
      came with a gotcha worth remembering — **a sticky child sticks below its
      scroll container's padding**, so `.teacher-scroll`'s 12px top padding
      left a band where turns scrolled past in the open, right under the panel
      title. The scroller gave up its top padding and the header carries it
      instead, which also made the panel's spacing uniform: 12px from any rule
      to the header below it, 12px from a header to its content, all from one
      symmetric padding.

- [x] **The source picker moves onto the section it scopes** *(v7.10.0)* — the
      ticket asked for the panel header: *"the ask bar carries three controls
      before you reach the text you're typing: the 📚 **source scope** picker,
      the 🔍 **Find papers** toggle and the **Filters** popover. Docked beside a
      graph the panel is narrow, and three of them plus the textarea and send
      is more than the width holds. **The ask:** in graph mode, put 📚 up in the
      panel header next to the 🎓 lecture-scope picker; in graph-free mode leave
      it exactly where it is."* *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-16.)*

      **It shipped one row lower than asked, and that's the interesting part.**
      The header version was built first, and Patrick killed it on sight:
      *"having the scope live in a section along with lectures doesn't tell the
      user what the scope is grounding: the q&a agent or the lecturer (it's the
      q&a agent obviously)."* A picker in the panel header — or in a peer
      "Grounding" section, the other candidate — claims to scope **everything**.
      Both scopes bind the *researcher*, so both now ride the **Chat** section's
      caret row, icon-only, where the row itself makes the claim. With no graph
      there are no sections, so the same one `sourcePicker` element falls back
      into the ask bar (rendered in one of two places, never both) — where the
      original reasoning still holds: the landing composer is wide and central,
      and the scope qualifies the question you are about to ask.

- [x] **The panel's title says both halves of the job** *(v7.10.0)* — the
      ticket: *"Rename 'AI teacher' above the graph chat to 'Discover' — a
      one-word change, but the word is doing work: 'AI teacher' names the
      implementation (there's an agent, it teaches), while 'Discover' names
      what the reader came to do. Worth a grep rather than a single edit — the
      phrase appears in the panel header, and possibly in the tour text and
      control tooltips, all of which have to move together per the in-app-help
      rule."* *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-15.)*

      **"Discover" shipped, then didn't.** It was in the branch for a day
      before Patrick landed on **"AI Teacher & Discovery"** — the panel does
      both, and naming only the discovery half lost the teaching one. The grep
      the ticket called for still happened: "AI teacher" is gone from every
      user-facing surface, and in *prose* (three tour cards, the controls
      panel's alt-drag hint and its tooltip) the thing is called **"the
      assistant"**, which is what the rest of the copy already called it.

- [x] **A lecture covers the seed's own neighbourhood, not the whole expanded
      graph** *(v7.7.0)* — expand the graph a few hops, then play a lecture,
      and it narrated the pulled-in papers as though the seed had cited them.
      *(Patrick's report, 2026-08-15.)*

      **The mechanism.** `_story_nodes` scoped each mode by **relation tag** —
      HISTORY kept nodes carrying `reference`, EVOLUTION `citation`, FRONTIER
      `latest` — and a paper `expand_node` pulled in carries the tag for the
      relation it has to *the paper it was expanded from*. A tag records what
      a relation **is**, never what it is **to**, so a reference-of-a-reference
      was indistinguishable from a reference of the seed. Latent since
      expansion shipped; it only bites once a reader uses both features
      together, which is why it took this long to surface.

      **The fix: scope by edges**, which can express what tags structurally
      cannot. `/api/lecture` now takes the graph's edges and `_seed_neighbors`
      keeps only papers joined **directly to the seed** by an edge of that
      mode's relation. Three deliberate choices: it is **direction-agnostic**
      (a `reference` edge runs seed → cited, `citation`/`latest` run citer →
      seed, but the question is adjacency, not direction — so a later relation
      can't be mis-scoped by pointing the other way); only edges **touching
      the seed** count (two references citing each other says nothing about
      either's place in a story); and an empty edge list **falls back to tag
      scoping**, because over-including beats a lecture with no papers in it.

      The ticket had framed this as a shape question — edges along, or nodes
      carrying their origin. Edges won on the grounds that they were already
      authoritative and already on the client: no model change, no persistence
      question, no second source of truth. The frontend's `_origin` (the
      layout hint `clusterForce` derives for orbiting satellites) was noted as
      a hint about the natural shape and deliberately **not** reused.

      **And the reader is told.** The lecture panel's intro now names how many
      expanded papers sit outside the seed's neighbourhood and says no lecture
      covers them, closing with the action that does ("Re-seed on one to hear
      its story") — the ticket's second question, answered the honest way. The
      count re-derives the **same predicate the backend scopes by**
      (`selectSatelliteCount`) rather than reusing `_origin`, because two
      independent notions of "satellite" is how a UI note drifts out of sync
      with the behaviour it describes.

      One trap worth knowing, pinned by a route test: react-force-graph
      **replaces a link's `source`/`target` strings with the node objects
      themselves**, in place — so `{"source": {...node...}}` is the normal
      shape off a live canvas. Parsing only strings would have yielded zero
      edges, fallen back to tag scoping, and restored the bug with every test
      still green. See [docs/bugs.md](bugs.md).

- [x] **Give the paper scout a semantic channel — "more like this one"**
      *(v7.4.0)* — the scout searched one way: lexical, over titles and
      abstracts. Its own prompt is where the weakness was already written down
      — "a paper matches only words that literally appear in its title or
      abstract, so an acronym or nickname finds nothing when the papers spell
      it out" — and reformulating the words was a workaround for not having the
      other channel. Now it has two that fail differently: `search` matches
      words, `more_like` matches meaning by hopping off a paper it has already
      found (SPECTER2 recommendations under S2, `related_works` under
      OpenAlex). The plumbing already existed — `traversal.neighbors(id,
      "similar", …)`, the researcher's own similar hop — so this is a second
      *consumer* of it rather than new reach.

      **It is not a peer of `search`, and the prompt has to teach that.** It
      takes a paper id, not a query, so it can't start a run: with nothing
      found there is nothing to be *like*. The shape it teaches is search →
      find one paper that is clearly the right kind of thing → ask for more
      like it, worth its cost exactly when the vocabulary is the problem (a
      field that renames itself, an idea with three names, a request phrased in
      the reader's words rather than the literature's). Both channels spend the
      same `searches` budget.

      **Whatever it finds is a plain `[n]` paper — no new chip, colour, glyph
      or node kind.** A chip's appearance says what the *click* does, not which
      API answered; both seed a graph, so a second visual axis would teach a
      distinction that never pays off at click time, and the reader doesn't
      need to know how the agent got there. Settled, don't re-litigate.

      The one design call worth remembering: `more_like` needs a **handle** on
      a paper, and ids are the obvious answer and the wrong one — a model
      handed ids starts inventing them. So the scout numbers its own results
      and takes that number. Those numbers are scout-local and never leave:
      they index `deps.found` (only what this run turned up), `ScoutResult`
      still hands back raw node dicts, and the prompt forbids naming one in the
      summary — because the researcher renumbers on its own terms and a number
      from one side would name a different paper on the other. The reader-facing
      trace borrows each provider's own word for the relation (`similar to:` /
      `related to:`), since SPECTER2 neighbours and concept overlap are not the
      same claim and the chip shouldn't say they are.

      Side effect worth noting: the workers had **no test package at all** —
      the researcher stubs them, so nothing exercised the scout's own logic.
      `test/curious_astronaut/agents/workers/search/papers/test_main.py` now mirrors it.
      *(Patrick's ask, 2026-08-15; shipped 2026-08-15.)*

- [x] **Retire the `search` node type — a discovered paper should attach to
      the graph, not float beside it** *(v7.3.0)* — free-text search results
      entered the graph as pink `search` nodes with **no edges**: a topic
      search links its hits to no specific paper, so they sat disconnected.
      That was the only way to surface them back when the chat couldn't hand a
      paper back; it hasn't been since v6.11.0 (a chat citation seeds its own
      graph) and v6.14.0 (it carries its provider). So `find_papers` now
      numbers its hits without drawing them — they stay readable, expandable
      and citable — and the reader promotes one deliberately by clicking `[n]`.

      **The rule came out broader than the ticket, because the narrow version
      shipped a crash.** The agent can `expand_node` a paper that
      `find_papers` found; that expansion hangs its edges off a paper the
      frontend hasn't got, and a link with a missing endpoint is not a stray
      line — d3-force raises while resolving link endpoints and takes the whole
      graph down. So the invariant is:

      > **The graph grows only where a new paper attaches to a paper already
      > on it.**

      One rule applied twice, rather than a special case per tool. Expanding an
      undrawn paper numbers its neighbours and draws nothing.
      `ResearcherDeps.on_canvas` tracks what the reader can actually see (the
      numbered list and the canvas are no longer the same thing), and
      `tools._canvas_growth` is the only place a `Discovery` is emitted.

      Read in the other direction the rule gives something back: when an
      expansion of a *drawn* paper turns up a paper that is numbered but
      undrawn, the edge it was missing now exists — so it's **promoted**,
      keeping its original number and gaining the relation that brought it in,
      so it colours as that rather than staying search-pink. A found paper can
      still reach the graph; it just has to earn it.

      **Nothing was deleted**, which is what keeps old saves working. The
      `search` relation, its pink and `primaryRel` all stay — the theme comment
      now says outright that it's legacy-but-load-bearing, so a later cleanup
      doesn't sweep it. The legend row and the filter behaviour were already
      gated on search nodes being *present*, so they vanish by themselves for
      new sessions and still render for old ones. The frontend merge also
      gained an endpoint check of its own: the server upholds the invariant,
      but a whole-graph crash is too severe a failure to leave resting on a
      server-side rule. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-15; shipped
      2026-08-15.)*

- [x] **Connect the web result to the paper — the scouts don't talk to each
      other** *(v7.1.0)* — the workers ticket shipped two scouts that each
      answered their own question and handed findings back separately. What
      was missing was the join: ask about Google's Willow chip and you got a
      web link to the announcement *and*, separately, some papers — but
      nothing connected the announcement to the paper behind it, and that
      paper is exactly what the reader wants to seed a graph on. The whole
      product claim is that a link becomes a map.

      **The measurement decided it.** The ticket offered two shapes —
      prompt-only, or a reconciliation worker running after both scouts — and
      said to try prompting first and measure, because the rule against
      speculative agents is the one that killed the orchestrator. Grepping
      `data/curious-astronaut.log` across a week of real runs settled whether prompting
      was already half-working: it wasn't working at all. Every paper search
      restated the user's question at topic level (`quantum computing advances
      2024`, `quantum physics breakthroughs 2023 2024 2025`), never once
      carrying a name the web had just supplied. Three causes, all in the
      code: the system prompt said *"each source is one call"*, nothing
      ordered the web before the papers, and the web tool's result told the
      model what to do with its pages **for the prose** and nothing about the
      graph.

      **Shipped prompt-only, in four places.** The researcher's system prompt
      states the join and the ordering rule (web first when the question is
      about what's new, so the paper search has names rather than topic
      words). `tools._WEB_HANDOFF` repeats it in the web tool's *result*,
      where the pages are in front of the model and the decision is actually
      made — withheld when no search is left, since an instruction the model
      can't follow just burns a step being refused. The web scout must now
      **name things** (the chip, the lab, the paper's own title where a page
      gives one, quoted verbatim, never invented) — it can't join what it
      never carried across. And the paper scout expects a need that names a
      *thing* rather than a topic, knowing the paper is titled after the
      result, not the product ("Quantum error correction below the surface
      code threshold", not "Willow") — so the name is one attempt and the
      claim is the next. `find_papers`/`search_web` log their `need` at INFO,
      which is the measuring instrument: two lines in sequence say whether the
      names crossed over, after the fact, on a run nobody watched.

      Measured after: one web search produced three name-carrying paper
      searches (`Google Willow quantum chip below-threshold error correction
      2024`, `Microsoft topological qubit majorana fermion quantum processor
      2025`, `IBM Quantinuum error rate reduction logical qubits 2024`),
      against zero in every run before. The reconciliation worker stays
      unbuilt and the door stays open — it's a different job from searching,
      so it would earn its own group beside `search/` rather than joining it.

      Testing turned up a **deadlock in the coverage guard** that predated
      this work: `_must_have_looked` read "available source" from config, so a
      run that spent its step budget before reaching the web was bounced for
      skipping a source, told to call a tool that could only refuse, and
      looped until the `UsageLimits` backstop ended it with the reader getting
      **nothing**. Fixed by making `_unconsulted` demand only what's still
      reachable — see [Bugs](bugs.md). `max_steps` went 12 → 16 alongside, for
      the separate reason that v7.0.0 and v7.1.0 gave the agent more to do per
      turn than 12 was chosen for. Two doc sweeps rode along: the two-tier
      split was documented as `v6.16.0` in 11 files (a tag that never existed
      — it shipped as v7.0.0 after the major-bump call), and `search_papers`
      still named the tool in eight places, one of them user-visible in
      Settings. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-15; shipped 2026-08-15.)*

- [x] **Ground the chat in the web too — workers and orchestrators**
      *(v7.0.0)* — the graph-free chat could only find *papers*, so "what's new
      in quantum computing" answered from Semantic Scholar's citation-weighted
      ranking, which structurally favours old, well-cited work — the opposite
      of what was asked — and couldn't see the announcement or release note
      where the news actually broke.

      **This is not the ambition cut in v6.8.0, and the distinction is the
      whole ticket.** What was killed there was *recall* — a soft prompt rule
      preferring the model's own knowledge over paper search, with nothing
      structural behind it. Web search is not recall: it is a **third grounded
      source**, as real, citable and retrievable as a paper or a page of the
      reader's own book. It *extends* the grounding boundary ("Curious Astronaut grounds;
      the line tells you in what") rather than abandoning it. Keep that
      reasoning in mind before "restoring" v6.8.0's decision over this one.

      **The architecture: flat, two tiers, no deeper.** `agents/orchestrators/`
      own an outcome and delegate; `agents/workers/search/` each own one source
      and answer a bounded question about it. The membership rule lives in
      `workers/search/README.md` so it isn't re-litigated: **a capability earns
      worker status when it needs judgment or context isolation — otherwise it
      stays a plain function.** Depth was rejected on two independent grounds:
      Anthropic's Managed Agents enforces single-level delegation, and current
      Opus guidance is to delegate *less*, since every hop re-establishes
      context and blurs the original question.

      **Two workers earned it.** The **paper scout** replaced the one-shot
      `search_papers` rather than joining it (two paths to one source is the
      bug): its judgment is reformulation and recency bounding — search, look
      at what came back, ask again with different words or a year floor. The
      **web scout** meets both criteria unambiguously, and runs on Anthropic's
      provider-side `WebSearchTool`, where `max_uses` is enforced by the
      provider rather than by us.

      **Workers return structured findings — never prose, never indices.** The
      paper scout hands back raw provider nodes and `find_papers` numbers them,
      because `[n]` must mean the same paper to the prose, the citation
      resolver, the provenance count and the frontend chip that builds a graph
      from it — an invariant that holds exactly as long as one agent owns the
      list. Web pages are cited as inline markdown links, not `[n]`, and are
      therefore *counted* in provenance rather than counted off the finished
      prose.

      **Coverage, not routing.** `_must_have_looked` now spans every available
      source instead of only the library, still gated on `answered` — a
      mandatory sweep on every turn is the v6.7.0 bug where saying "hi"
      searched the student's books, three times over. A source counts as
      consulted when it is *already in front of the model*, so a question about
      the open graph isn't bounced for failing to re-search the literature it
      was built from. A zero web budget unregisters the tool **and** drops it
      from the guard — one availability fact, two readers.

      **The router went with it.** `orchestrator.run` and the `Intent` enum
      were deleted: it dispatched two known intents to two agents and never
      grew the model half it was designed around, so the enum was a string
      round-trip between a route and the function beside it. Routes call the
      agent they mean. The two things it genuinely carried landed where they
      belong — the Done/Error termination contract became `streams.terminated`
      (shared plumbing: a workflow owns its events, not how a transport learns
      it finished), and lecture mode scoping moved into the lecturer, which now
      scopes its own input. One visible consequence: a lecture's numbered list
      is chronological, so `[1]` is the oldest paper.

      **Major, for one reason.** The package moves and the router's deletion
      are invisible — the HTTP surface is unchanged and saved sessions still
      restore. What breaks is `config.json`: the two new `llm.agents` entries
      and `researcher.extras.web_searches` are required, and their absence is a
      `LookupError` at startup, not a soft drift. A release that won't boot on
      the previous release's config is breaking in the way that matters.

- [x] **The graph-free chat follows the provider dropdown — and its citations
      carry the backend that minted them** *(v6.14.0)* — two symptoms, one root
      cause, both confirmed in `data/curious-astronaut.log`. `streamAskSources` had no
      `provider` field and `api_ask_sources` never read one, so the landing
      chat always ran on the *default* backend no matter what the header's
      "Data source" dropdown said. Symptom 1: switch to OpenAlex, ask a
      question, and the log fills with `semantic_scholar.client` requests.
      Symptom 2: the v6.11.0 seeding click then fails — the answer's
      `PaperRef.node_id`s are 40-hex S2 paperIds while the click builds with
      the *workspace's* provider, so the request is
      `?seed=<S2 id>&provider=openalex` and `openalex.resolve_seed_work` has
      nothing to resolve. Threading the provider through, via the same
      `resolve_provider` every other provider-keyed route uses, fixes both.

      **The second half is the interesting one.** Threading it through fixes
      the common case but not the *class* of bug: a `node_id` means nothing
      outside the provider that issued it, and nothing bound the two. Switch
      the dropdown after an answer, or restore a session saved under the other
      backend, and live chips still point at ids the current provider can't
      resolve. So `PaperRef` now carries its own `provider`, stamped by
      `prompts.paper_refs` from the run that produced it, and the click builds
      under *that* — taking the workspace's dropdown with it, because the
      alternative is a header naming one backend while the graph and every
      expand off it run on another.

      Choosing that over the other option on the table — greying the chip when
      the providers disagree, the treatment stale graph refs already get — was
      the one judgement call, approved on test. A dead chip on an answer you
      can still read is a worse outcome than a click that works; what the grey
      would have bought is *no surprise*, and that's bought more cheaply by
      naming the consequence before the click. A chip from the other backend
      reads "Map this paper's citations, **switching to Semantic Scholar** —
      {title}" on hover. Refs saved before v6.14.0 carry no provider and fall
      back to the selected one, which is exactly the old behaviour.

- [x] **A chat citation maps the paper — and brings the conversation with
      it** *(v6.11.0)* — in graph-free mode the agent's `[n]` markers rendered
      as external links to Semantic Scholar: the app's whole reason to exist
      was one click away, and that click went somewhere else. Now the marker
      builds that paper's graph and opens its detail panel.

      Most of the wiring already existed — `PaperRef` has carried `node_id`
      since v6.7.0, `GET /api/graph` already accepted a raw provider node id
      as a seed, and selecting the seed already opened the panel. **The real
      work was transcript continuity.** `loadGraph.fulfilled` bumps `epoch`,
      the transcript slice reset itself on that action, and `<Teacher
      key={epoch}>` remounted — so the obvious implementation would have
      *destroyed the answer being read* in order to inspect a paper named
      inside it. A `fromChat` flag on the thunk now carries the one intent
      through both slices: the transcript survives, and
      `workspace.revealSeedDetail` tells GraphExplorer to open the new seed's
      panel once, then clears itself so ✕-ing the panel doesn't spring it back
      open. A cold search from the header still starts a fresh conversation,
      which is right — the exception is precisely the case where the jump
      *continues* one thought.

      **The prose problem, and the design that fixed it.** First cut rendered
      each cited paper's full title inline. It derailed the sentence — badly
      when two papers backed one claim, worse when a title arrived in caps —
      so the chip went back to the bare `[n]` the prose was written around,
      with the title on hover. That was safe to do only because *this ticket
      removed the reason the title was there*: the v6.7.0 note in `events.py`
      argued a graph-free `[n]` would otherwise be "dead text with no way to
      learn what paper it was", and the marker is not dead any more.

      That left a subtler problem Patrick caught: after the jump, one
      transcript holds **both** kinds of chip — one that spotlights a paper on
      the canvas, one that rebuilds the workspace — and a reader shouldn't
      discover which by clicking. So the two are a matched pair in one visual
      language, differing exactly where the behaviour does: **three nodes
      wired together** (teal) builds a graph, **one node lit** (accent blue)
      spotlights one already on it. Marked in *shape* as well as colour on
      purpose — colour alone says that they differ without saying what, and
      says nothing at all to a colour-blind reader. Drawn as inline SVG rather
      than typed: nothing in unicode reads as a citation graph, and the near
      misses (`⁂`, `⌗`) render inconsistently across fonts. Lecture beats
      route through the same component, so they pick up the spotlight glyph
      too.

      **Two consequences of transcript survival, caught in testing and fixed
      in the same release** — both of them invariants this ticket broke rather
      than pre-existing bugs. **The panel remounted.** The shell keys `Teacher`
      on `workspace.epoch`, so a load rebuilt the transcript's scroll container
      at the top, throwing the reader back to the start of the answer they had
      just clicked out of — the store kept the conversation and the DOM threw
      it away. A chat-seeded load now skips the epoch bump entirely, which is
      the honest reading of the flag: same session, same panel. That moved the
      stream-abort guarantee off the unmount it used to ride on, so
      `useConversation` aborts on the seed changing under a live panel instead
      — otherwise a lecture streaming in the background would keep pushing
      discoveries into the new graph. **And citations could go stale.** An
      answer written against graph A survives onto graph B, where its `[n]`
      markers resolve to node ids that are no longer loaded: live-looking chips
      that silently highlight nothing. They now render greyed and inert,
      checked per-chip against `selectWorkspaceNodeIds` and coming back to life
      by themselves if that paper turns up on a later graph. Deliberately the
      *loaded* node set rather than the *visible* one — keying on the
      year/citation filters would have chips flickering as a slider is dragged.

      **And one behaviour change the release made safe, rather than broke.**
      Testing turned up that a cold search from the header still wiped the
      chat — long-standing, deliberate ("a fresh graph starts a fresh
      conversation"), and now wrong for the same reason the chat-seeded jump
      was: *"even if my chat starts with quantum computing and then switches
      to DQN, perhaps it should be up to the user to clear their chat"*
      (Patrick). It should. The slice's two halves have different owners — the
      **chat is the user's**, so clearing it is theirs to do (the Clear button,
      or Home), while **lectures belong to the graph**, since a lecture
      narrates the neighborhood you built and its beats point at that graph's
      nodes. A graph load now keeps the chat and drops the lectures. That was
      only safe to change *because* stale citations already degrade — before
      this release a surviving transcript meant a screenful of dead pointers,
      which is exactly why the reset was wholesale. `fromChat` got simpler in
      the process: it no longer gates the transcript at all, and only opens the
      seed's detail panel. The bubble-level click went the same way as the
      chip-level one — an answer whose whole grounding set has left the graph
      stops being clickable, with partial overlap still counting, because
      lighting the papers that *are* here is useful.

      **Dropped deliberately:** the paper's own landing page is no longer
      linked from the answer. It's one click further, in the detail panel the
      seed opens — the graph is the point, and a second affordance per
      citation was the clutter the compact chip existed to remove.
      *(From the 2026-08-10 design conversation; shipped 2026-08-13.)*

- [x] **Curious Astronaut grounds — the general-assistant ambition is cut** *(v6.8.0)* —
      two days after the librarian retirement shipped, a scope correction that
      is mostly deletion. v6.7.0 had tried to give the graph-free chat a
      general-purpose character: a prompt rule preferring the model's own
      knowledge over `search_papers`, machinery to detect when recall was
      used, and a plan to measure whether it ever was. Patrick killed it after
      testing (2026-08-08): *"this feels like we are trying to do too much."*
      He was right, and had said so earlier — *"I don't really see the agent
      ever using its own recall if it can just search S2"* — which is exactly
      what the logs showed.

      **Why it couldn't work.** The rule was a soft prompt preference against
      an always-available tool, with nothing structural behind it, unlike the
      library guard it sat beside. And the instrument meant to measure it was
      measuring the wrong thing: `Provenance.searches` counted *library*
      searches only, so a turn that ran off to Semantic Scholar and a turn
      written purely from the model's weights both reported zero. The plan to
      "watch the grounding line for recall answers" could never have worked as
      built.

      **Why it shouldn't work.** Claude Desktop already does general knowledge,
      web search and RAG, and always will do them better — that is what it is
      for. Curious Astronaut's value is the citation graph and the student's own material;
      competing on general chat is unwinnable and off-mission. The distinction
      that survives: recall as *scaffolding inside a grounded answer* (what a
      Bellman equation is, on the way to answering something a paper does
      cover) is on-mission, needed no machinery, and was never at risk. Recall
      as a *general fallback for arbitrary questions* was the thing being
      built, and it was the wrong thing.

      **What went.** The graph-free "prefer your own knowledge" prompt rule;
      the `ANSWER_LENGTH` heuristic that guessed whether a conversational turn
      was really an answer; and two Backlog tickets chasing the behavior. What
      stayed: the look-before-you-answer guard (the actual product value — it
      is what killed "hi searches my books"), and provenance, now **fixed to
      count paper searches separately** so the line distinguishes "searched the
      literature and cited none of it" from "nothing was searched at all". The
      resulting product story is simpler and more honest than what it replaced:
      *Curious Astronaut grounds; the line tells you in what; if nothing grounded it, it
      says so and you take the question elsewhere.*

- [x] **The conversational loophole, narrowed** *(v6.7.1)* — a follow-up to
      the librarian retirement, plus the bug that hid behind it.
      `_must_have_looked` only fires on an `answered` turn, and `kind` is
      self-reported by the model the guard constrains — so the enforcement was
      only as strong as that one field's honesty, in a ticket that had
      *explicitly rejected* self-reported provenance for exactly that reason.
      Narrowed rather than closed (whether a turn is a real question is
      irreducibly a judgment): `answered` became the prompt's default with
      `conversational` enumerated exhaustively, and `kind` now rides on the
      `Provenance` event and the log so the classification is greppable.
      Shipped alongside the bug that prompted the investigation and turned out
      to be unrelated — a recall answer rendering no grounding line at all when
      no library was in scope (`docs/bugs.md`).

- [x] **The librarian is retired: one researcher, retrieval as a tool, honest
      provenance** *(v6.7.0)* — a consolidation of three tickets that turned
      out to be one design question ("the librarian searches even when I say
      hi", "may the researcher answer from its own knowledge", and "graph-less
      research mode").

      **The problem.** `librarian.answer()` called `sources.search()` as its
      first statement, before the model was engaged at all. Saying "hi" ran a
      hybrid FTS5 + vector search over the student's books, which either
      returned arbitrary nearest neighbours (the model then answered a greeting
      out of whatever surfaced) or returned nothing and met the greeting with a
      canned "I couldn't find anything in your library about that". No prompt
      could fix it — the model never got a say. Quieter but worse in ordinary
      use: the retrieval query *was* the raw user question, so a follow-up like
      "what about the second one?" went to the index verbatim.

      **The shape.** The librarian was already a strict subset of the
      researcher — same retrieval, same figure tool, same event bridge, same
      structured-output pattern; the only real difference was *when* retrieval
      fired. Making retrieval a tool left nothing behind, so the package, its
      config entry, its workflow playbook, its settings knobs, `Intent.LIBRARIAN`
      and `RetrievalTrace` all went. `/api/ask_sources` now runs the researcher
      with no seed and no nodes — that absence *is* graph-free mode, and the
      graph-less research ticket fell out of it for free. The two chats keep
      separate history stores, as before.

      **Grounding-by-construction had to be replaced, not dropped.** When
      retrieval ran before the model, the model *could not* answer without the
      passages; as a tool it can skip them and answer from memory, which a
      student would reasonably mistake for their own book talking. Prompting
      harder was the approach already known to fail here (the agent skips
      `show_figure` when asked outright), so the guard is structural: `Answer`
      gained `kind: conversational | answered`, and an output validator
      (`_must_have_looked`) raises `ModelRetry` when an `answered` turn never
      reached retrieval despite having a library. It asks whether the library
      was **consulted**, not whether it helped — an empty search satisfies it,
      or an empty library would make every answer unreachable.

      **Recall is allowed, and the ordering was the interesting part.** The
      obvious rule — "fall back to your own knowledge only when sources can't
      answer" — fails on the case that matters most: if a book is *outdated*
      it still answers, so retrieval succeeds, fallback never fires, and the
      stale answer ships with no signal. Strict fallback can only trigger when
      a source is silent, never when it's wrong. So the enforcement is on
      **looking**, not on ordering the prose: always search first, answer from
      sources where they speak, add recall where they don't, and flag
      disagreement explicitly when the field has moved on.

      **Provenance is derived, not declared.** A third `parametric` enum case
      was considered and rejected — real teaching answers are mixed (the book
      supplies the objective, recall supplies the background it assumes), so a
      turn-level provenance label misreports the common case in both
      directions. `kind` stays enforcement-only. What the UI shows instead is
      computed from what the server *watched happen*: searches run, passages
      returned, sources and papers the finished prose cites (`Provenance`).
      A model has no reliable access to which of its sentences came from a
      passage and which from its weights, so asking it would produce a
      confident label with nothing behind it. The wording lives in the
      frontend (`transcript/provenance.ts`), which distinguishes "nothing in
      your library matched — answered from background knowledge" from plain
      recall; those are very different things to tell a student.

      **Two bugs came out of it, both in `docs/bugs.md`:** a rejected answer
      streaming to the screen before the validator could reject it (output
      validators run *after* the output tool call completes, but prose streams
      out of that same call), and paper citations going dead in graph-free mode
      — the same "resolution lives on only one side of the wire" pattern
      v6.6.0 had just fixed for library sources, caught by Patrick in browser
      testing. Fixed by a `PaperRefs` event carrying title + URL, so `[n]`
      renders as a linked paper title when there's no graph to point at.

      Shipped with the graph-free preference for recall over `search_papers`
      as a **soft** prompt rule rather than a hard hook, deliberately — the new
      provenance line makes "does it ever actually use recall?" measurable, so
      that question went to the Backlog to be answered from real use instead of
      guessed at.

- [x] **A failed figure chip drops the source and mislabels the figure**
      *(v6.1.1)* — a failed `show_source_figure` rendered as a bare "Tried
      **Figure 1**", naming neither the source it reached into nor the figure
      it actually asked for. The renderer was innocent
      (`teacher/transcript/ChatMessage.tsx` already drew "of <title>" when
      given one); the emitters weren't. Failure traces in
      `agents/library_figures.py` now look the source title up from
      `source_id` (degrading to an unnamed chip if that lookup itself fails,
      so it can never mask the original error) and carry an **attempted**
      label — `figure 2 on p.42` — instead of falling back to
      `Figure {figure}`, which asserted a number the source may not use
      (`figure` is a *page-local ordinal*, not the book's own numbering).
      **Writing the test found a second bug:** `captions.split_label` matched
      only dotted numbering, so chapter-hyphenated forms truncated —
      "Figure 3-2. Two-slit interference." became label `Figure 3` with the
      caption left starting at a stray `-2.`, i.e. the chip named a different
      figure than the one on screen. The regex now takes hyphen/en-dash/
      em-dash numbering, but only when digits follow immediately, so a spaced
      "Figure 3 - A single slit" keeps its dash. Guarded by a new
      `test/curious_astronaut/agents/test_library_figures.py` (every emit path's chip
      contract) plus caption cases; story in `docs/bugs.md`. *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-19; browser-tested. The separate "no figures
      extractable from the Feynman Lectures" investigation stays open — this
      fix made its failure legible, not solved.)*

- [x] **Phase 3a — AI teacher + Q&A (grounded)** *(v1.1.0)* — `teacher.py` with
      the dual Claude backend (Anthropic API **or** the `claude` CLI subscription)
      **streamed** so narration reveals beat-by-beat. `/api/lecture` (SSE) emits
      ordered lecture **beats**, each bound to graph nodes that **light up in
      sync**; modes: *history* ("how we got here") and *intuition* (bridge mode
      exists in the backend, no UI button yet). `/api/ask` (SSE) answers
      conversational, **session-scoped** questions grounded in the on-screen
      graph, streaming tokens then highlighting the **cited nodes**. Frontend:
      the `Teacher.tsx` panel + a `highlightIds` glow/dim path reusing the
      focus-on-hover machinery. *Grounded in the visible neighborhood only — no
      full-text reading or graph-jumping yet (that's 3b/3c).*
- [x] **Phase 3b — Agentic Q&A: full-text reading** *(v1.5.0)* — the Q&A agent
      now runs a **tool-use loop** (`read_paper` tool, via ar5iv full text or
      abstract+TL;DR summary) before answering. Hard guardrails: 4 full-text reads,
      12 summary reads, 12 agent steps, 90 s wall-clock. Each read emits a live
      **trace event** (`📖 Read <title> · full text`) in the chat before the answer
      streams. `fulltext.py` extracts readable body text from ar5iv HTML (math,
      scripts, and figures stripped; 30-day cache). Requires the Anthropic API;
      falls back gracefully to the Phase 3a grounded answer with the CLI backend.
- [x] **Phase 3c — Agentic reach beyond the graph** — the Q&A agent escapes the
      visible neighborhood, in two steps:
  - [x] **3c.1 — Graph traversal (`expand_node`)** *(v1.7.0)* — the agent fetches
    papers **not yet on the graph** (one hop of references / citations / similar
    from a paper already in context) and auto-merges them as new nodes (distinct
    dashed **"discovered" ring**, anchored near their source so they don't fly in
    from the origin), with a **hop budget** (5) and **visited-set** to kill
    reference cycles; each hop emits a live **trace event** (`🔗 Expanded
    references of <title> · N new`) and discoveries feed back into the grounding
    context for follow-up questions. Q&A answers are now **clickable sections**
    like lecture beats — click to re-light the papers an answer was grounded in,
    click again to clear. *(Shipped 2026-07-03; browser-tested. OpenAlex keyless
    fallback still an open question — see below.)*
  - [x] **3c.2 — Topic search (`search_papers`)** *(v1.8.0)* — traversal alone is
    lineage- and embedding-biased, not recency-biased: a 2026 paper citing a 2017
    seed has had no time to accumulate citations of its own, so questions like
    *"what's the latest transformer architecture in 2026?"* can't be reached by
    hops from an old seed. The agent now has a `search_papers(query, year_from?,
    year_to?)` tool hitting S2's paper-search endpoint directly (**ungrounded** —
    no source node) with a **year filter** so "latest" queries bias recent. Hits
    merge in under a distinct **`search` relation** (its own pink color +
    "Found by search" legend, *not* `similar`) with its **own budget** (3 searches,
    separate from the hop budget) and its own visited-set; results **float,
    anchored near the seed** (no edge — the link is topical, not verified) and feed
    back into the grounding context. Live **trace event** (`🔎 Searched "query"
    (2024–now) · N new`). Also this cut: Q&A answers now emit the same `<<CITED>>`
    sentinel as the grounded path, so a **follow-up answered from context** (no
    re-read) still highlights the papers it drew on. *(Shipped 2026-07-03;
    browser-tested.)*
  - **CLI/MCP path + lecture enrichment** remain unscoped stretch ideas beyond
    3c.2. **OpenAlex** keyless traversal fallback was later
    resolved by the v5.0.0 provider split — not built; a manual `S2_API_KEY` is the
    reliable path for `expand_node` / `search_papers` under rate limits.
- [x] **Phase 3e — "How we got here" time travel** *(v1.14.0)* — the history
      lecture no longer starts mid-stream: before narrating, `history_backfill`
      walks **backward through references** to a field's older roots. It launches
      from the **oldest papers already on the graph** (expanding the seed just
      re-finds its visible refs), each hop adding the most-cited new ancestors and
      carrying the oldest into the next hop, bounded by a hop budget
      (`LECTURE_HISTORY_HOPS`) and a **year floor** (`LECTURE_HISTORY_LOOKBACK`
      years before the seed). Discovered ancestors merge into the live graph
      (dashed rings; far-left in Timeline) and join the node set the lecture
      narrates over; the panel shows the hops live (`⏳ Traced back to <year>`).
      Deterministic, so it runs on both teacher backends, reusing the Phase 3c
      `_s2_neighbors` machinery. Shipped with an **S2 request throttle** (~1 req/s,
      `S2_MIN_INTERVAL`) so the backward burst — and graph build / agent expansion
      — don't 429. *(Browser-tested — reaches genuinely older foundational work; a
      specific origin paper can still be missed since additions rank by citations
      over a narrow frontier — future tweak: prefer `influential` edges.)*
      **Retired in v3.0.0** — lectures no longer expand the graph (see
      "Lectures never expand the graph" under Enhancements); the history
      lecture now narrates the visible ancestors, ending at the seed.

- [x] **Phase 3f — "What's Evolved Since" lecture mode** *(v2.7.0)* — a **third
      lecture button** alongside "How We Got Here" (history) and "This Paper's
      Intuition" (intuition), completing the **past → present → future**
      triptych. It's the exact **mirror of the history backfill**: the shared
      walk was refactored into one `_walk(direction=…)`, and evolution runs it
      *forward* — launching from the **newest visible descendants** (launching
      from the seed itself just re-finds its already-shown citations and
      stalls), hopping **citations** (each hop reaches strictly newer work),
      keeping the most-cited new papers, and marching toward the present with no
      year ceiling (nothing can be cited by the future). The orchestrator runs
      `forward_backfill` before narrating (same enrich-then-lecture path as
      history); discoveries merge as descendants (dashed rings, far-**right** in
      Timeline). `BackfillTrace` gained `direction`/`newest` (a forward hop
      reports the newest year reached), rendered as **"⏩ Traced forward to
      \<year\>"**; a new EVOLUTION mode-intent tells the lecturer to start at the
      seed and move forward to the current frontier. Kept deterministic and
      LLM-free like the history walk — the roadmap's optional `search_papers`
      frontier-grab was deferred. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-07.)*
      **Walk retired in v3.0.0** — lectures no longer expand the graph; the
      mode (button, intent, seed-onward scoping) lives on, narrating the
      descendants the even-by-year citation spread puts on screen (see
      "Lectures never expand the graph" under Enhancements).

- [x] **Lectures never expand the graph — backfill walks removed** *(v3.0.0)* —
      a doctrine change: a lecture narrates the graph **as the user built
      it**; only the researcher (explicit Q&A) may pull new papers onto the
      canvas. The deterministic history/evolution backfill walks (Phase
      3e/3f) were removed end-to-end — `orchestrator/backfill.py` + tests
      deleted, the lecture intent is pure delegation, `BackfillTrace` left
      the event vocabulary, the `graph.backfill` config knobs are gone, and
      the panel's "⏳/⏩ Traced…" chips + the saved-session `hist_trace`
      field were retired (old saves still restore; the field is ignored).
      The **directional modes are also scoped to their side of the seed**
      (`_story_nodes`): "How we got here" receives only the seed + papers
      published in or before its year — the story ends AT the seed — while
      "What's evolved since" receives the seed onward; intuition/bridge see
      everything (undated papers sit out of the clamped modes; an undated
      seed disables the clamp). **Scoping reworked in v4.8.0** — modes are now
      pinned to a graph *relation* (references / landmark citers / latest), not
      a year clamp (see "Lectures tightened" above).
- [x] **Lectures tightened: per-relation scoping, a PDF-reading intuition, and
      full-span guardrails** *(v4.8.0)* — each lecture is now pinned to one graph
      relation instead of a slice of the timeline (`_story_nodes`): "How we got
      here" narrates the seed's **references**, "Summarize the landmark papers
      since" (renamed from "What's evolved since") the **landmark citers**, "The
      current frontier" the **Latest Publications**, and "This paper's intuition"
      the **seed alone** — so the four stories no longer overlap and
      loosely-`similar` work never leaks into a directional lecture. **Intuition
      now reads the PDF:** the ar5iv reader preserves equations as LaTeX
      (`keep_math` lifts the MathML `alttext`, KaTeX-rendered), and the intuition
      lecture pulls the seed's full text to teach it in detailed chapters with
      real math. **Full-span guardrails** stop a lecture clustering on the
      oldest, most-cited papers: the numbered list is sorted oldest-first and
      banded by era (`node_lines_by_era`), a concrete YEAR₁–YEAR₂ span line plus
      the `_SPAN_NUDGE` tell the model to reach both ends, and beat counts
      widened 5–9 → 7–12. The current frontier stays a **thematic** survey
      (grouped into current threads) but oriented forward in time. `frontier_
      window_months` no longer filters nodes (the `latest` relation already is
      the recent frontier) — it only frames the FRONTIER narration now. Closes
      "Lectures should span the whole publication history." *(Patrick's asks,
      browser-tested 2026-07-10.)*
- [x] **Lecturer knobs: configurable frontier window + beat-count bounds**
      *(v4.2.0)* — the lecturer gained an `extras` staging area in its
      `config.llm.agents` entry (the researcher's budget pattern — unknown
      keys fail at import). **`frontier_window_months`** (default 60) widens
      "The current frontier"'s recency window from the hardcoded 12 months
      to **~5 years**: since the v4.0.0 OpenAlex hybrid, the light-green
      Latest Publications nodes span the newest years plus the
      `latest_band_years` per-year bands below them, so a 12-month lecture
      narrated almost none of what the graph actually shows as "latest."
      The FRONTIER mode-intent phrases the same window into the prompt
      (`_window_phrase`) so the narration and the `_story_nodes` filter
      can't drift, and the year-only fallback for OpenAlex's coarse dates
      now errs toward inclusion (the cutoff's year, not a hardcoded
      `today - 1`). **`min_beats` / `max_beats`** (default 5–9) make the
      lecture's bubble count tunable — phrased into the system prompt
      ("exactly N" when both ends pin to the same value); a prompt bound,
      not a hard output cap. *(Patrick's asks, browser-tested 2026-07-09.)*
- [x] **Refocus "This paper's intuition" on the seed itself** *(v3.0.0)* — the
      intuition lecture no longer reads like a second "How we got here": its
      mode-intent now walks the paper's own components (the problem, the core
      idea, how the method actually works, what the results showed, why it
      works), naming surrounding papers only in passing for contrast. It's
      also **grounded in the seed itself, deterministically** (the lecturer
      stays tool-free): the seed's own **ar5iv figures** are fetched before
      the run and listed by caption — the model attaches the most
      illuminating one to the beat it belongs to (a `figure` number resolved
      to a proxied image on the beat; hallucinated numbers just mean no
      figure) and the panel renders it inline under the beat (click to
      enlarge) — and, when a **local library** exists, hybrid retrieval on
      the seed's title supplies passages the lecture may draw on, attributed
      inline. **History and evolution are illustrated too:** their figure
      pool draws from the seed plus the story's landmark papers (the 4
      most-cited arXiv papers on the mode's side of the seed, 3 figures
      each, source-paper attributed on the card); bridge stays figure-free.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-07.)*
- [x] **Figures in agent answers** *(v1.20.0)* — the agentic Q&A can now pull a
      paper's own figures into its answer. A **full `read_paper` lists that paper's
      figures** (numbered captions) and a **`show_figure(index, figure)`** tool
      attaches one — resolved through the existing `figures.py` (ar5iv) extraction +
      the same-origin `/api/figure_proxy`, streamed as a `figure` SSE event and
      rendered (image + caption) in the answer bubble with a **click-to-enlarge
      lightbox** (backdrop / ✕ / Esc to close). Budgeted at `AGENT_MAX_FIGURES`
      (3/answer); agentic path only. A `🖼 Showed Figure N of …` trace chip marks it.
- [x] **Embed answer figures inline (not appended)** *(v1.22.0)* — each
      `show_figure` attachment now gets a 1-based **slot**, and the tool result
      instructs the agent to place a **`<<FIG n>>` marker** in its prose exactly
      where the figure belongs. The marker streams through verbatim (no SSE
      protocol change); the answer bubble **splits its text on markers and
      interleaves the figure cards** (a partial marker at the streaming tail is
      held out of the render so it never flashes). Degrades gracefully: an
      unplaced figure falls back to the old end-of-bubble strip, a marker with no
      matching figure vanishes without gluing paragraphs, and pre-v1.22 saved
      sessions render as before (new saves restore inline placement free, since
      markers live in the persisted text). Two fixes from browser testing:
      markers are **stripped from the server-side conversation history** (a model
      that saw `<<FIG 1>>` in its earlier answers skipped placing the fresh one,
      so figures degraded to end-anchoring as the chat went on), and the system
      prompt now hard-forbids the model **drawing figures itself** (ASCII art /
      box characters) — `show_figure` is the only path to visuals. *(Known limit:
      tool-call compliance is still somewhat inconsistent; see the agent-
      reliability item below.)*
- [X] **Agent reliability: stronger model or sub-agent decomposition** — even
      with the hardened prompt, the agent sometimes skips `show_figure` (or
      tools generally) and answers from context. Two levers to explore: point
      `AGENT_MODEL` at a stronger model than the default (`TEACHER_MODEL`,
      Sonnet 4.6) just for the tool loop; or **break the loop into sub-agents**
      (e.g. a researcher that reads/expands and a writer that composes) so each
      keeps a **small, focused context** instead of one long conversation
      carrying every tool result. *(Patrick's observation while testing inline
      figures, 2026-07-04.)*
- [x] **"Powered by Claude"** *(v1.11.0)* — subtle top-bar credit (Anthropic
      sunburst mark + "Powered by Claude", linking to anthropic.com/claude);
      names the model the AI teacher actually runs on, not the build tool.
      **Removed in v5.3.1** (see "UI & rendering polish").

- [x] **Feed already-played lectures into the researcher's context** *(v4.12.0)* —
      the Q&A researcher now **draws on lectures already played this session**
      instead of re-deriving the same ground (cheaper — fewer tool calls/tokens —
      and consistent with what the lecture said). The frontend packs the
      transcript cache's lectures (trimmed to each beat's heading + text, titled
      via the shared `LECTURE_TITLES`) into `streamAsk`'s new `lectures` field;
      the route parses them defensively into typed `PlayedLecture` models
      (`agents/models.py`), threads them through `orchestrator.run` →
      `researcher.answer`, and `_prompt` folds them in under a "build on these,
      don't repeat them" header, **budgeted** by `_LECTURES_MAX_CHARS` (6000) so a
      full set of four can't blow the prompt. A **🎓 scope picker** — the sources'
      `ScopePicker`, generalized to serve both scopes via a `labels` config —
      filters which played lectures are fed (tracked by exclusion, so a
      newly-played lecture is included by default), with a one-line note above the
      ask bar showing how many are in play. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-11; browser-tested.)*
- [x] **Keep "frontier" out of the "landmark papers since" lecture** *(v5.28.1)* —
      the evolution lecture ("The landmark papers since", narrating the landmark
      citers) sometimes ended on a beat whose **title contained the word
      "frontier"**, which is usually wrong for this mode and reads as a spillover
      from the separate **"The current frontier"** lecture (the `latest` relation)
      where that vocabulary belongs. The node pools were never the leak — landmark
      citers and Latest Publications are disjoint by id, and `_story_nodes` scopes
      each mode by `rels` tag — the **EVOLUTION mode-intent itself** told the
      model to end "at the current state of the art", inviting exactly the
      where-is-the-field-heading close that belongs to the frontier lecture. Now
      it ends "at the newest landmark on your list", with an explicit fence: the
      CURRENT FRONTIER is a separate lecture — no surveying what's active right
      now, no forecasting where the field is heading. *(From the `todos.md`
      inbox, 2026-07-11; browser-tested.)*

### Bring-your-own sources

- [x] **Structured library citations — the model cites an index, the reader
      sees a title** *(v6.6.0)* — Part 1 of the "make inline library-source
      citations first-class" ticket (Part 2, clickable-to-page, stayed in the
      Backlog — see below). Before this, a claim drawn from an uploaded book
      was attributed in plain prose (`"(Deep Learning, p.243)"`) that rendered
      as dead text and **could not be resolved back to the source**: the prose
      carried only a title the model had freely reworded — abbreviated,
      prettified, or the raw upload slug. The concrete case that settles it:
      a source stored as `the_feynman_lectures_vol_III_quantum_mechanics` gets
      written mid-sentence as "The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. III",
      which no exact-match lookup will ever find.

      The fix mirrors the protocol papers have used all along: **the model is
      shown a numbered list and writes an index, never an id.**
      `prompts.source_lines` numbers the library (`[S1] "Title"`),
      `format_passages` tags each retrieved passage with the marker to copy
      verbatim (`[S1, p.243]`, or `[S1]` for a page-less web source), and
      `source_refs` resolves those markers back to real ids server-side. An
      index is the only token a model reproduces exactly; a title is not.
      The reader never sees the wire format — the frontend renders `[S1,
      p.243]` as *"(Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, p.460)"*.

      Three decisions worth keeping. **(1) The map streams *before* the
      prose**, unlike `Cited`: it is keyed by index alone and carries no page
      (the page is already in the marker), so it is complete as soon as
      retrieval settles — otherwise every marker would render raw until the
      answer finished, then pop. **(2) Papers and sources resolve on opposite
      sides of the wire** — the frontend already holds the numbered paper list
      so it resolves `[n]` itself, but only the backend knows which of the
      user's sources a given turn retrieved, so `[Sn]` arrives pre-resolved as
      a `SourceRefs` event. **(3) The source tools moved onto indices too** —
      `show_source_figure(source=1, page=243)` and `search_sources(query,
      source=1)` — because the model no longer sees ids at all, which is the
      whole point; an out-of-range `[Sn]` comes back as tool text, never a
      raise.

      Also killed the **fake citation example** that had leaked into every
      system prompt: `"(Deep Learning, p.243)"` named a source no library
      contains, and appeared in four places at once — `librarian/config.py`
      (as `[Title, p.N]`, brackets), `skills/citation-discipline.md` (as
      `(Title, p.243)`, parens — the two prompts disagreed on the format),
      `agents/README.md`, and the tour's "Chat with your books" step. One
      format now, no invented source.

      Scope grew once mid-branch, correctly: the **lecturer** also loads
      `citation-discipline`, so changing the skill alone would have had
      intuition-mode beats emitting markers nothing rendered. It came along —
      beats already render through the same `AnswerMarkdown`, so it was
      wiring a per-lecture source map (`lectureSources`, one per lecture
      rather than per beat) through the store. Saved sessions predating the
      change restore fine; their markers, if any, degrade to raw text, the
      same way an unresolvable `[n]` always has.

- [x] **Figures from uploaded PDFs in answers** *(v5.28.0)* — the library
      analogue of `show_figure`, shipped for BOTH answering agents. Uploaded
      PDFs now **keep their original file** beside the indexed text
      (`data/source_pdfs/<id>.pdf`, removed with the source; older uploads and
      URL sources degrade to "no figures"), and the caption-anchored extractor
      built for open-access papers mines them into a per-source **figure
      manifest** (`services/sources/figures.py`, month-cached, no pixels
      stored; images render on demand at `/api/sources/<id>/figure/<n>`). The
      **researcher** and — added mid-branch on Patrick's call — the
      **librarian** both carry a `show_source_figure(source_id, page, figure)`
      tool over one shared core (`agents/library_figures.py`):
      page-addressed to match how passages are cited (`[Title, p.N]`), with
      the prompt carrying an id → title map of the retrieved sources. Giving
      the tool-less librarian a tool forced two structural borrowings from the
      researcher: the `streams.drive` event bridge (so `Figure`/`FigureTrace`
      events flow live between text deltas) and a structured `Reply` output —
      plain-text streaming leaked tool-turn narration into the answer, caught
      by a scripted test (`streams.partial_text` is now the shared prose
      streamer). Browser-testing surfaced two notable extraction bugs (both in
      `docs/bugs.md`): the **backup-diagrams incident** (a miss message
      listing pages without captions invited attaching an unrelated figure and
      hallucinating its content — fixed by caption-carrying candidate lists,
      nearest-page-first, plus caption echo on every attach) and the
      **Sarsa(λ) incident** (a captioned textbook figure unminable for three
      stacked reasons: paper-sized caps, a dust filter that ate
      diagram-piece swarms, and contact-only chaining that couldn't walk
      sparse diagonal pieces — fixed by per-corpus `config.pdf`
      `research_papers`/`library_documents` caps, thresholding the region
      instead of the inputs, and axis-aware `_chain_near`; verified on the
      real 548-page book: 119 floats in ~6s, Figure 12.9 mined and rendered).
      Figure cards/chips/lightbox now display the float's own designation
      parsed off its caption (`agents/captions.py` → the events' `label`
      field; "Figure 12.4 · source — caption"), falling back to slot order
      when a caption has none. The mining geometry is documented in depth in
      `services/pdf/README.md` § "The geometry, precisely".

- [x] **Phase 3d — Bring your own sources** — pull the user's own material into
      the teacher's reach so Q&A can draw on it alongside the papers it fetches —
      "how does this paper relate to chapter 3 of my textbook?" Books are far too
      big to stuff into context, so this is **local RAG**: chunk → embed → search.
  - [x] **3d.1 — Ingest + local semantic library** *(v1.9.0)* — uploaded **PDFs**
    (per-page text via `pymupdf`, so retrieval cites an exact page) and **web
    pages** (paste a URL; readable text via the shared `fulltext.html_to_text`)
    are split into overlapping page-aware chunks, embedded **locally** (revived
    `embeddings.py`, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim — no API/key, so copyrighted books
    never leave the machine) and stored in a dedicated **sqlite-vec** index
    (`sources.py`, `data/sources.db`, cosine KNN). A **global persistent library**
    (survives across graphs) with CLI ingest/search/list/forget (`run.py`).
    Degrades gracefully via `available()` if the model / sqlite-vec can't load.
    *(Shipped 2026-07-03; verified on real books via CLI.)*
  - [x] **3d.2 — Agent tools + UI** *(v1.10.0)* — the agentic loop gets a
    `search_sources(query, source_id?)` tool (own budget
    `AGENT_MAX_SOURCE_SEARCHES=5`, `📚 Searched your sources` trace line), offered
    **only when a library exists** (an empty library never loads the embedding
    model). The agent sees the library listed in its context (so it can scope to
    one source) and **cites passages inline by page** — "(Deep Learning, p.243)".
    A **📚 Sources drawer** (top bar) uploads PDFs / pastes URLs and manages the
    library (`GET/POST /api/sources`, `DELETE /api/sources/<id>`; 256 MB uploads).
    Sources aren't graph nodes, so they cite rather than highlight the graph.
    *(Shipped 2026-07-03; browser-tested — the teacher pulls from uploaded books
    in Q&A with page citations.)*
  - **3d.3 — polish** *(scoped)* — remaining source-library polish:
    - [x] **per-source scoping in the UI** *(v1.13.0)* — the offline library chat
      gets an "All sources / one source" picker (shown at 2+ sources) that scopes
      retrieval; `source_id` flows question → `/api/ask_sources` →
      `answer_from_sources` → `sources.search`.
    - [x] **optional stronger embed model** *(v1.13.0)* — swap in `bge-small`
      (also 384-dim, so `ARXIV_EMBED_DIM` is unchanged) via `ARXIV_EMBED_MODEL`,
      with a query-only instruction prefix (`ARXIV_EMBED_QUERY_PREFIX`, empty by
      default) for asymmetric retrieval; re-ingest sources to apply.
    - [x] hybrid **FTS5 + vector (RRF)** for exact-term / proper-noun lookups
      *(v1.21.0)* — `sources.search` now fuses a **semantic** ranking (sqlite-vec
      cosine KNN) and a **lexical** one (FTS5 BM25) via **Reciprocal Rank Fusion**,
      so an exact term / proper noun / hyperparameter the embedder blurs together
      (e.g. "β2", a dataset or author name) still surfaces. An external-content
      `chunks_fts` index is kept in sync by insert/delete **triggers** (so
      ingest/delete needed no changes; cascade-deletes purge it too) and
      **back-fills existing libraries** on first connect — no re-ingest. Degrades
      cleanly: no FTS5 → pure vector (prior behavior), no embed model →
      lexical-only, neither → empty. Config `ARXIV_SOURCE_HYBRID` (default on) /
      `ARXIV_SOURCE_RRF_K` (60). Verified: on an exact-term query hybrid lifts the
      right passage from a razor-thin vector-only lead to a decisive win.
    - figure/image handling — **OCR for scanned PDFs** — still open; moved to
      the Backlog in [OnePager.md](../OnePager.md).
- [x] **Offline chat mode** *(v1.12.0)* — a graph-free RAG chat straight over the
      local library. `teacher.answer_from_sources` retrieves the top passages
      (`SOURCES_CHAT_K`) and answers grounded only in them, citing inline by page —
      retrieve-then-answer (no tool loop), so it runs on both teacher backends.
      New route `POST /api/ask_sources` (SSE, own session store) + a `LibraryChat`
      modal reachable from a top-bar "💬 Ask library" button and an empty-state CTA
      (both shown only when a library exists).
- [x] **Parallel multi-file source upload + multi-select scope** *(v1.19.0)* —
      the Sources drawer now takes **many PDFs at once** (a `multiple` picker
      **and** drag-and-drop) and ingests them **in parallel** (a 3-wide pool over
      the threaded server), with **per-file progress** rows (`embedding… → ✓ added`
      / `✕ failed` with the message). Alongside it, the assistant's source-scope
      control went from a single-select dropdown to a **checkbox popover** — a
      checked box = that source is on (defaults to all), so scoping is now a true
      **subset**, not one-at-a-time. Backend: `sources.search` `source_id` →
      `source_ids` (an `IN (…)` filter), threaded through `answer_from_sources` /
      `answer_agentic` / the `search_sources` tool and both ask routes.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-03.)*
- [x] **Unified assistant panel** *(v1.18.0 — supersedes the old "toggle to
      library-agent view" idea)* — collapsed the two overlapping chat surfaces
      (the docked `Teacher` panel and the `LibraryChat` modal) into **one
      header-toggled docked panel** whose capability levels up with context:
      **no graph, has library** → a graph-free chat over the uploaded library
      (`streamAskSources` → the backend-agnostic `answer_from_sources` path);
      **graph open** → the lecture + agentic Q&A (`read_paper` / `expand_node` /
      `search_papers` **and** `search_sources`). A **🎓 Assistant** header toggle
      opens/collapses it (active-state styled); it auto-opens on graph load. Docked
      (not a scrim-drawer) so answers still light up graph nodes; **collapsed =
      hidden but mounted**, so toggling preserves the in-progress conversation. The
      v1.17.0 source-scope selector works in both modes. `LibraryChat.tsx` +
      `library-chat.css` deleted; **backend untouched** (both endpoints already
      existed — the panel just routes by graph presence).
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-03; shaped + shipped 2026-07-03.)*
- [x] **Source selection for the AI Teacher** *(v1.17.0)* — the Teacher panel
      gained the same source-scope control the library assistant has: an **All
      sources / one source** dropdown (shown when the library has >1 source) that
      **pins the agent's `search_sources` to the chosen source** — only that source
      appears in the agent's "Your library" context and every source search is
      forced to it (a scope matching nothing disables source search rather than
      silently widening). Threaded `source_id` through `/api/ask` →
      `answer_agentic`; the graph-only paths (lecture, non-agentic Q&A) ignore it.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-03.)*
      **Next:** fold this into a **single unified assistant panel** (see the
      library-view toggle item) — one header-toggled drawer that defaults to the
      library with no graph open and levels up to graph + S2 tools once one is.
- [x] **Deselect-all in the assistant source scope** *(v1.20.1)* — the source-scope
      popover only had **Select all**; added a **Deselect all** (shown whenever any
      source is checked) so you can clear and then pick a few, rather than unchecking
      many by hand.
- [x] **Empty source scope means "search nothing"** *(v1.20.2)* — corrects
      v1.20.1: an empty checkbox set used to fall back to "search the whole
      library" (both extremes behaved the same). Now the three states are
      distinct — all checked = whole library, a subset = just those, **none
      checked = search no sources**. Threaded a `None` (no scope → all) vs `[]`
      (explicit empty → nothing) distinction through `sources.search`, both ask
      routes, `answer_agentic`, and the `search_sources` tool.
- [x] **A lone source hid its own filter — so the agent couldn't be told to
      leave it alone** *(v7.2.0)* — completes the pair above, three years
      later. v1.20.2 made "none checked" mean *search nothing*; this makes it
      reachable. `Teacher.tsx` gated the source picker at
      `libraryItems.length > 1`, on the reading that a lone source leaves no
      choice to make — but "use it / don't" is a choice, and it's exactly the
      one a reader with a single uploaded book wants: without the picker there
      was no way to ask a question *without* their textbook in play.

      **The fix was one token** (`> 1` → `> 0`). Everything behind it already
      worked end to end: unticking sets `scopeArg = []`, the route preserves
      the empty list against `None`, `answer()` filters the library to nothing,
      `search_sources` is never registered, and the coverage guard stops
      counting a library the reader just excluded. The lecture picker beside it
      had always rendered at `> 0`, so the two had quietly disagreed since the
      Phase 6 split.

      **`ScopePicker` had never been rendered at one item**, though, and needed
      to read sensibly at that size: a single item now drops the All/None bulk
      actions (they sat directly above one checkbox doing the identical thing)
      and labels itself "1 source" rather than claiming "All sources" — which
      matters more than it sounds, because in the ask bar the trigger is its
      icon alone and that label survives only in the tooltip. The tour step
      taught the old rule ("shown once you have two or more sources") and moved
      in the same change.

      Two tests filled gaps the ticket exposed rather than gaps it created:
      `[]` and `None` are opposite instructions that both look falsy, and
      nothing pinned the empty list surviving the wire, nor the far end where
      an empty scope must *remove* the tool rather than merely return nothing.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-15; shipped 2026-08-15.)*
- [x] **Windows PDF upload fix** *(v1.10.1)* — source ingest used a
      `NamedTemporaryFile` whose exclusive lock on Windows made the reopen fail
      with `[Errno 13] Permission denied`; switched to `mkstemp` + manual cleanup.
- [x] **GPU embedding on Windows without shared memory** *(v5.8.0)* — the local
      embedder ran on CPU; on a Windows box with a discrete GPU (dedicated VRAM,
      no shared/unified memory) CUDA should make ingest much faster. It did:
      **~19×**, 80 → 1497 chunks/s on an RTX 3070 Ti (2000×900-char chunks,
      25.1s → 1.34s); a real 40-page PDF ingests in 0.33s.

      The ticket assumed the fix was device-detection code. It wasn't — that was
      the **wheel**. sentence-transformers *already* auto-selects CUDA; PyPI's
      Windows torch is simply a CPU-only build, so there was no CUDA runtime to
      find. `pyproject.toml` now declares torch directly (uv sources only apply
      to direct deps) and routes it to PyTorch's `cu130` index behind a
      `sys_platform == 'win32'` marker, keeping the 1.8GB wheel off macOS/Linux,
      where this repo is also worked on. `explicit = true` stops that index
      shadowing anything but torch. Detection code alone would have shipped a
      no-op that *looked* like a feature.

      What the code adds is control and visibility, not detection:
      `config.sources.embedding.device` (default `auto`) resolves to `None` and
      lets sentence-transformers choose — it already handles cuda/mps/xpu and
      stays right as torch grows backends, so a hand-rolled
      `torch.cuda.is_available()` ladder would be strictly worse. An explicit
      device overrides; one that won't load falls back to CPU with a logged
      warning (slow beats unavailable), verified against the real library with a
      bogus `cuda:7`. The load logs the device it landed on. Also folded in the
      sentence-transformers 5.x `get_sentence_embedding_dimension` →
      `get_embedding_dimension` rename (the old name emitted a `FutureWarning`
      and will eventually go), raising the nominal `>=3.0` floor to the `>=5.6`
      we actually lock. *(Shipped 2026-07-16; browser-tested on a real PDF
      upload. From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-07.)*

### Citation graph — landmark/latest & mega-papers

- [x] **Collapse Field Landmarks and Latest Publications into one `citation`
      relation — and, with it, four lecture modes into one lecture over what the
      reader has scoped** *(v7.17.0)* — the graph shipped two kinds of citer as two
      separate things: `citation` (all-time most-cited citers) and `latest`
      (the recent-years frontier), with their own colours
      (`graph/theme.ts:59`), their own legend rows
      (`controls/Legend.tsx:39-43`), their own cluster angles (landmarks
      up-right, latest down-right — `graph/clusterForce.ts:50`), their own
      filter chips, and their own lecture modes (`evolution` / `frontier`).
      The argument for merging: with citation counts, date filters, and an
      agent grounded in whatever is selected on screen, **the reader can tell
      "old and important" from "new" themselves** — we don't need to impose a
      threshold and call it a taxonomy.

      **The strongest evidence for the ask is that the app already half-does
      it.** `theme.ts:87-90`'s `BADGE_LABEL` maps `latest` → `"citation"` so
      the detail panel shows one badge, with the comment *"Latest Publications
      ARE citing papers"*. And old saves are safe: `theme.ts:99`'s
      `UNKNOWN_EDGE` exists precisely so *"a retired edge type can't draw an
      invisible line on an old save"*, so cached snapshots
      (`graph:v2:<provider>:`) and saved sessions carrying `latest` edges
      degrade to a visible neutral edge rather than breaking.

      **The trap: the label and the fetch are not the same decision, and only
      the label is cheap.** They are two different *acquisition* strategies,
      not two views of one result set. Landmarks are the seed's citers ranked
      by citation count; the latest band is a separate query **per year**
      (`services/graph/build.py:184-217`, `bands.py`, `budget.py`), sized by
      `tau`/`max_span` constants **fitted on a labelled 64-seed corpus** — and
      the whole reason that machinery exists is that a recent paper has not
      accumulated citations yet, so it **never survives a citation ranking**.
      Merge the fetch and the graph silently becomes old-biased: the frontier
      disappears, and no date filter can bring back a node that was never
      fetched. `bands.py`'s own docstring is about closing exactly that
      landmark→latest gap.

      **So the ticket is: keep two fetch strategies, ship one relation.**
      Concretely — `Edge.type` (`services/graph/model.py:77`) drops to
      `reference | citation`, `Counts.latest` folds into `Counts.citations`,
      one colour and one legend row, one cluster angle. What has to be
      *decided*, not assumed:
      - **Does the node keep a trace of which query found it?** A
        non-rendering provenance field costs nothing and keeps the corpus/live
        note and any future debugging honest; rendering it is what we're
        removing.
      - **What happens to the `evolution` and `frontier` lectures?**
        `lecturer/main.py:367`'s `_MODE_RELATION` scopes them by edge type, so
        with one relation they narrate the same node set. Either merge them
        into one "what came after" lecture (four buttons become three — which
        interacts with the router ticket in *Teacher & agent reach*), or
        re-scope `frontier` by **date** instead of relation, which is the
        reader-decides principle applied consistently.
      - **The date filter has to be good enough to replace the split**, since
        it inherits the job. Check it can actually express "the last two
        years" cheaply on a graph where year coverage is uneven (OpenAlex
        per-work years are unreliable — `bands.py` was designed around that).

      **Docs that stop being true:** `docs/landmark-vocabulary.md` is the
      single definition of this vocabulary and is linked from the code, the
      READMEs and the research notebooks; `docs/predict-vs-compute.md` holds
      the why. Neither should be deleted — the *fetch* rules they describe
      survive this change — but both need a note that the distinction is no
      longer user-facing. *(From the developer, 2026-09-08.)*

      **Shipped, and it grew a second half.** Collapsing the relation was the
      small part: `Edge.type` dropped to `reference | citation`,
      `Counts.latest` folded in, and one colour / legend row / chip / cluster
      sector (citations moved from -PI/3 to due east) replaced two.
      `SNAPSHOT_VERSION` went v2 -> v3 because `Counts` lost a field, and a
      restore folds a pre-v7.17.0 save's `latest` tags via
      `foldRetiredNodeRels` — not cosmetic: the chips are keyed by relation, so
      an unfolded `latest` node belongs to no chip and would come back
      invisible. **Both fetch queries survive untouched**, `tau`/`max_span`
      included; only the seam went. `docs/landmark-vocabulary.md` and
      `docs/predict-vs-compute.md` carry a note that their terms now name two
      *queries*, not two things a reader sees.

      **The lecture half was the developer's call, made while the ticket was
      open** (the entry's own open question — "what happens to the `evolution`
      and `frontier` lectures?" — with the answer "retire the modes
      entirely"). `LectureMode` is gone, and `_story_nodes` no longer rebuilds
      a node set from the edge list: it narrates the scope the frontend sends
      and adds nothing to it. The four buttons had been *overriding* the
      reader's own filters and selection — select five papers, press a button,
      watch it narrate something else — which is the v7.7.0 scoping bug's own
      lesson (the app deciding it knew better than what the reader did) one
      level up. Three intents remain, chosen structurally: a `target` means the
      bridge lecture, a scope of **one paper — any paper, not just the seed**
      means a solo deep read of it, and anything else takes the reader's
      `framing`.

      **`framing` (summary | history) is the one input the scope cannot
      express**, and the line is worth holding: *which papers* is always the
      scope's answer, *how to tell them* is always the reader's. Summary is the
      default, because a chronological arc is a strong claim to make about an
      arbitrary selection — and forcing one produced beats about the *timeline*
      ("notice the gap after [1], the graph jumps to 2023-2026") rather than
      about any paper. The era-banded list and span line are now history-only,
      and a `SYSTEM_PROMPT` rule bans narrating the list itself.

      **Three things browser testing turned up**, each its own fix: a beat lit
      3 papers while naming 16 (`node_ids` was the model's 1-4 picks, the prose
      cited far more via `graph_refs` — now unioned and deduped; see
      `docs/bugs.md`); a large marquee drew a label per node at every zoom,
      painting a white block over the graph (`LABEL_ALL_MAX` caps the
      always-label exemption at 12); and the seed had no chip, making it the
      one paper a reader could not scope out — so `CHIP_TYPES` was split from
      `REL_TYPES` and the seed got one. The lecture's scope also became
      *strictly* visible (`selectLectureNodes`), diverging from the
      researcher's grounding on one question: grounding keeps a discovered
      paper a filter hides, a lecture must not narrate a paper the reader
      cannot see.

- [x] **A truncated shard passed as a finished download — the corpus pull now
      measures completeness, and `astronaut corpus verify` audits what's already on
      disk** *(v7.12.0)* — an ingest of the 2026-08-05 release died 36 minutes
      in, at citations shard 355/395, on a DuckDB "malformed JSON … unexpected
      end of data" that pointed at the wrong layer entirely. The shard was
      truncated on disk — 577 MB of a 1.07 GB object — and had been renamed to
      its final `.gz` and checkpointed `done` anyway.

      **Why the downloader couldn't tell.** CPython's
      `http.client.HTTPResponse.read(amt)` does *not* raise `IncompleteRead`
      when the socket dies mid-body; it returns `b""` and closes, by a
      deliberate stdlib compatibility choice. A dropped connection is
      therefore indistinguishable from a clean EOF, so streaming "until read
      returns empty" and then renaming is not a completeness test at all — and
      the resulting `download.json` entry was self-consistent and wrong, which
      is why re-running `download` skipped the bad shard instead of fixing it.

      `_download_shard` now measures the body against `Content-Length` before
      the `.part` → `.gz` rename, raising `_ShortRead` and leaving the partial
      file for one of five `Range` retries to resume. The checkpoint stores the
      advertised size, so a mismatched shard is re-fetched rather than trusted;
      a 416 is resolved by probing the object's true size instead of guessed
      at. `astronaut corpus verify [--deep] [--repair]` is the audit for corpora
      pulled before the guard existed — size against the Datasets API, then
      optionally a full decompress, then optional repair.

      **The result that justified the sweep**: a `gzip -t` pass over all 455
      shards (408 GB) found exactly one casualty. The failure's quiet variant —
      a cut landing on a line boundary — would have ingested cleanly, earned
      its `_done` marker, and silently dropped every edge after the cut.
      Repairing the real shard cost only the missing 497 MB, since a truncation
      cuts the tail and the surviving bytes are a valid prefix. The downloader
      had no test file at all before this; `test_download.py` (15 tests) now
      covers the guard, resume, expiry refresh, and verification — pull the
      four-line check and three of them fail. Full story in `docs/bugs.md`.

- [x] **Retire `similar` from the graph too — a citation map should be made of
      citations** *(v7.5.0)* — the purple papers `expand_node` pulled in were
      related by *embedding*, not by an edge anyone wrote, so they asserted a
      relationship the literature never did. They also arrived with edges,
      which is why v7.3.0's attach rule didn't catch them: this needed its own
      rule, and the rule is the sentence in the title.

      **The change is one type.** `expand_node` takes a `traversal.CitationHop`
      (`"references" | "citations"`) instead of a `Relation`, and that
      narrowing *is* the enforcement — a similar hop isn't refused at runtime,
      it can't be **asked for**, because the tool schema the model sees offers
      two values. The dead `else` branch that built `type="similar"` edges went
      with it. The capability didn't move out of reach: the paper scout hops
      the same data as a second way to *search* (v7.4.0), handing back ordinary
      papers, so related work still reaches the answer — as `[n]` citations
      rather than as canvas furniture. That's why the scout's semantic channel
      had to land first. Widening the Literal back would silently restore the
      old behaviour and break nothing else, so a test reads the *schema*.

      **Then both retired relations were deleted outright**, on Patrick's call.
      The first cut kept `search`'s pink and `similar`'s purple against saved
      sessions from before — but checking the data rather than assuming showed
      there were none (the one saved session held `seed` and `latest` only), so
      that was two dead concepts carried for a hypothesis the data disproved.
      Gone: both colours, `EdgeType`/`Edge.type`'s `similar` member, `REL_TAG`'s
      entry, both cluster-force sector headings, the legend's "Found by search"
      row and its `selectHasSearchHits` selector, the always-on filter entries,
      the canvas arrow exception, the `rels=["search"]` stamp `find_papers` put
      on a paper it doesn't draw, and `Counts.similar`.

      One rule replaced the two exceptions: **`primaryRel` is total**, drawing
      any relation this build has no meaning for as grey `unknown`, with
      `UNKNOWN_EDGE` as the edge twin — so retiring a relation can never
      produce an undefined fill, now or next time. `Counts.similar` was the
      one field with an argument for keeping it: `Graph` is what the day-cached
      snapshot is validated back through, so under `extra="forbid"` dropping a
      field turns every stored snapshot into a *validation error* rather than a
      miss. The real fix was the one the repo already used elsewhere
      (`expand:v4:`) — the graph cache key carries a **schema version** now
      (`graph:v2:…`), so an incompatible entry is unreadable instead of
      poisonous and ages out on the TTL. Bump it whenever `Graph` loses a
      field. Falling out of the same sweep: an edge-less node is now simply
      *shown* rather than gated on a filter chip it has no relation for.
      *(Patrick's ask, 2026-08-15; shipped 2026-08-15.)*

- [x] **Corpus ingest degrades ~3x across a release — the partitioned write
      re-examines what's already on disk** *(v5.13.1 — patch; the ticket's
      hypothesis **refuted**, the real cause found and fixed)* — v5.6.0 fixed
      the *file explosion*, but per-shard cost still climbed across the
      2026-07-07 ingest: 26.5 s/shard for the first ten, 76.0 for the last
      (2.9x), ~5.7h actual against the ~2.2h a single-shard benchmark
      predicted. The suspected mechanism — `OVERWRITE_OR_IGNORE` +
      `FILENAME_PATTERN '<stem>_{i}'` re-scanning the ~400k accumulated files
      to resolve `{i}`, with DuckDB's newer `APPEND` mode as the fix — was
      **benchmarked and refuted**: writing into the *real* end-of-release
      399,360-file tree costs the same as into an empty directory, in both
      modes. What the marker-mtime forensics + five benchmarks actually found:
      (1) the "step" in the curve sits exactly at the export-batch boundary
      because batch-2 shards carry **39% more edge rows** (83.1 vs 59.7 MB
      Parquet out) — data mix, not degradation; (2) the remaining climb is the
      partitioned write slowing down **per process** — reproduced 3.04x in 8
      minutes with output *deleted* every iteration, surviving a DuckDB
      reconnect, indifferent to tree state, thermal (perf counters flat) and
      Defender (0 CPU), sparing single-file COPYs of the identical
      sorted+zstd payload, and resetting to cold speed with every fresh
      process — allocator/heap wear from the 1024 per-partition writers.
      **Shipped:** the citations shard loop routes through a single-worker
      `ProcessPoolExecutor` recycled every `_SHARDS_PER_WORKER = 16` shards
      (markers still written by the parent, after the rows are on disk); runs
      with no more pending shards than one quota stay in-process, keeping
      tests and resume-tails spawn-free. A/B through the real `ingest_release`:
      in-process climbs 2.42 → 4.70 s over 20 synthetic shards, recycled saws
      back to 2.48 s at shard 17 — sub-linear scaling restored, worth roughly
      5.7h → ~3h on a full release. Full story in **Bugs** (with the "benchmark
      against a populated tree" lesson upgraded: the tree was never the
      variable — the *process age* was). Suite 510 → 511. *(Filed 2026-07-15
      while ingesting the first full release; shipped 2026-07-17.)*
- [x] **Every landmark budget is computed now — the model retires from serving,
      and a fully-reachable live pool gets the corpus shape** *(v5.13.0)* — born
      from Patrick re-deriving the budget design in conversation (2026-07-17)
      and landing on the destabilizing question: *"do we really need the budget
      model at all?"* The answer was no — but not for his proposed reason, and
      the correct reason was better. Pulling OpenAlex's whole pool would cost
      ~150 requests (~30k citers for DQN — correcting both his "13k", which is
      S2's count, and the docstrings' "130k", a typo). What kills the model is
      that **the STOP rule is prefix-local**: it never reads past the first year
      to overflow, and OpenAlex serves the ranking sorted, so everything the
      rule will ever read sits in the first 200-row page — the same single
      request the *predicted* path already made. `predict-vs-compute.md`'s
      "predict" regime rested on an unexamined premise ("computing needs the
      whole pool"), and checking what the rule actually *reads* emptied it.
      **What shipped:**
      **(1) OpenAlex computes** (`openalex._budgeted_landmarks`): probe one
      ranked page, run `budget.computed_cite_limit` over its years, trim to the
      count; a seed whose top-200 never overflows pays one ceiling-sized refetch
      and re-measures. Deletes the model's ~21-citer per-seed error and — a
      bonus — restores the `PER_YEAR_CAP` invariant on this path, which a
      size-only prediction never could enforce (a blockbuster year could exceed
      12; a STOP prefix cannot).
      **(2) A complete live S2 pool ships the corpus shape** — Patrick's other
      catch: the live path treated *every* pool as a recency sliver, but a seed
      whose citer list ends before the ~9k offset ceiling (most seeds) is a
      *whole history*, and the sliver arguments evaporate. `_fetch_reachable_pool`
      now reports completeness (S2's own `next` flag — a page can run short
      mid-list when S2 fails to resolve papers, so page length can't be the
      signal; a full raw page is belt-and-suspenders continuation), and a
      complete pool gets STOP-prefix landmarks + tau-banded per-year Latest
      (`_complete_pool_relations`, mirroring the corpus source
      decision-for-decision). STOP alone would have recreated the 18-month hole
      against the rolling window — the tau bands are what close it. Truncated
      pools keep SKIP + the window; the offset-ceiling wall is now a per-seed
      caveat, not a path-wide one.
      **(3) The model is retired from serving, not deleted**:
      `budget.adaptive_cite_limit` and `build._adaptive_cite_limit` are gone;
      `predicted_budget`/`load_model` and the artifact remain as the
      `latest_gap` collector's dependency and the label's derivation record (a
      follow-up ticket weighs folding them into `ml_pipelines`). The STOP rule's
      "only ever a training label" story — already stale since v5.11.0 —
      is rewritten everywhere: it is the serving rule for every whole-history
      pool, and the label second. `predict-vs-compute.md` gains an epilogue
      ending: *predict only what you can't observe — and check "can't observe"
      against what the rule reads, not the size of the pool it's defined over.*
      Also filed: the SKIP-rule spike (is per-year banding what a truncated
      sliver should even ship, or is honest provenance labelling the real fix?).
      Suite 499 → 510; browser-verified on OpenAlex, a parked-corpus live build
      (QMIX showing per-year bands), and a corpus sanity build.
- [x] **Cold corpus builds take ~47s — the `papers` dataset is unsorted, so
      nothing prunes** *(v5.12.0; diagnosed 2026-07-17, the original prime suspect
      **refuted** — see below)* — a cache-miss graph on the s2 provider takes ~47s
      against the live path's ~15s. **It is not the citations bucket.** Measured on
      DQN (bucket 372, 390 files, 29 MB):

      ```
      scan the bucket (390 files), filter, group by      0.07s   -> 31,902 rows
      open all 390 parquet footers                       0.01s
      the same query + JOIN papers                       2.03s   -> 96% of the cost
      ```

      Hash-partitioning + `ORDER BY citedcorpusid` are doing exactly their job; the
      390 files are free. **Compacting buckets would buy nothing** — the old ticket
      spent its whole argument on a suspect that costs 0.07s. (The small-files point
      may still matter for the *ingest* scaling ticket, and for Athena. Just
      not for this.)

      **The real cause is projection width against an unsorted `papers`.** Parquet
      is columnar, so every column projected is more bytes off the disk, and the
      same join at four widths:

      ```
      1 column   (corpusid)                              0.73s
      3 columns  (+ year, citationcount)                 1.09s
      8 narrow   (everything but authors)               20.64s
      9 columns  (what the app selects, incl. authors)  39.24s
      ```

      `authors` alone — a JSON blob per paper — costs **+18.6s**. And the app reads
      all nine columns for **31,878** citers to ship **63**.

      **But fetching fewer rows doesn't help, and that's the finding.** Hydrating
      those 9 columns for just the 63 winners still took **33.28s** — the same as
      for all 31,878. Why: **every one of `papers`' 1,946 row groups spans 100% of
      the corpusid range** (728 … 289,920,059 out of 0 … 289,923,617). The rows
      landed in arrival order, so every zone map says "maybe" and **nothing prunes**.
      Any corpusid lookup is a full scan of 24.8 GB, whether it wants 63 rows or 31k.

      **The ingest asymmetry that caused it** (`corpus/ingest.py`): the citations
      COPY ends `ORDER BY citedcorpusid` and partitions by bucket. The papers COPY
      does **neither** — no ordering, no partitioning. One missing `ORDER BY` is the
      whole 20–40s.

      **The fix is two changes that only work together** — each is useless alone,
      which is why the obvious single fixes were measured and rejected:

      **(a) Cluster `papers` by `corpusid`** — **and it must be *global*, not
      per-shard.** Adding `ORDER BY corpusid` to the existing per-shard papers COPY
      would NOT work: every shard holds ids spanning the whole 0–290M range, so
      sorting inside one still leaves each of its row groups covering ~1/32 of the
      range, and scattered ids hit them all. It needs either a post-ingest
      compaction pass over the whole dataset (`COPY (SELECT * FROM
      read_parquet(papers/*) ORDER BY corpusid) TO …`, so each output row group owns
      a contiguous slice) or `PARTITION_BY (corpusid % NBUCKETS)` + sort within,
      mirroring what citations already does. **Tested on a 4-file, 1.8 GB subset**
      (written as one globally-sorted output): row groups' average id-range width
      collapsed from
      **289,918,845 (the whole range) to 2,027,421**, and a 63-id lookup went
      1.65s → 0.65s. The subset *understates* it — 63 ids hit ~44% of that
      subset's 143 row groups, but only ~3% of the full dataset's 1,946, so the
      full-scale win should be ~30x. Keeps the Parquet/Athena endgame — Athena
      prunes on the same stats. **Alone it is not enough:** the *ranking* query
      genuinely needs all ~31k citers, so it touches every row group regardless.

      **(b) Two-phase fetch** — rank on `(corpusid, year, citationcount)` (the
      budget rule only reads years), trim to the budget, then hydrate the wide
      columns for the ~63 winners. **Alone it does nothing:** measured, hydrating 63
      ids took **33.28s**, the same as all 31,878, because on an unsorted layout
      DuckDB must scan to find them. It only pays off once (a) makes small lookups
      cheap.

      **Together:** rank narrow (~1.1s) + hydrate 63 from a clustered `papers`
      (~1s) ≈ **2s against today's 39s**.

      **(c) If (a) disappoints**, the honest fallback is that **Parquet has no index
      and point lookups want one**: a DuckDB *native* table with an index on
      `corpusid` would make this milliseconds — but it abandons the Athena-over-S3
      story, so it's an architectural fork, not a tune-up. *(Patrick noticed
      fetching citations is slow, 2026-07-16; re-diagnosed and the fix tested
      2026-07-17, after he asked the obvious question — "I thought DuckDB was
      supposed to be fast? Do we need to index the db or something?" — which was
      closer to right than the ticket's own prime suspect.)*

      **Shipped (v5.12.0), both halves, (c) not needed.** (a) became a
      **compaction pass at the end of every papers ingest** — the global variant,
      as tested: shard files land as before (the incremental resume unit), then
      one `ORDER BY corpusid` sort rewrites them as `clustered_*` files. The swap
      is crash-safe (staged in `_compacting/`, committed by a `MANIFEST.json`,
      resumed *before* the shard loop so an interrupted swap can never
      double-ingest) and `_done/` markers keep reruns idempotent. The
      subset-extrapolated "≈3 minutes" was optimistic — the full 24.8 GB exceeds
      DuckDB's memory cap, spills (`_spill/`), and ran **~10–15 minutes** on the
      real release; a DuckDB progress bar now shows during the sort (added after
      Patrick sat through the gap with no feedback). `astronaut corpus compact`
      migrates a pre-v5.12.0 corpus in place off the parquet root alone. (b) is
      the query shape in `source.py`: both citer queries rank narrow
      (`corpusid, year, isinfluential`), the landmark budget rule now travels
      *into* `landmark_citers` and trims **between the phases** — it still
      measures the full ranked pool, the v5.11.0 invariant — and only the winners
      are hydrated wide. Browser-verified on the real corpus: cold s2 builds
      dropped from ~47s to roughly the live path's ~15s. 8 new tests (clustered
      layout + global sort, no re-sort on rerun, legacy migration,
      interrupted-swap resume) take the suite to 499.
- [x] **The corpus path stops predicting and starts measuring — and gets a real
      frontier** *(v5.11.0)* — the corpus served real all-history citers but used
      neither trained model properly: `cite_budget` was *predicting* a number the
      local pool could just be asked for, and `bands.earliest_band_year` was never
      wired in at all, so Latest Publications was the **flat rolling 12-month
      window** inherited from the live fallback. The one provider with every edge
      and every date had the least honest frontier.
      **Both halves are now measured, not argued** (`live_pool_validation`'s
      verdict — see the entry below):
      **Landmarks compute.** The model's premise *did* hold here (R² **0.644** on
      corpus pools against its own cross-validated **0.680** — a −0.037 transfer
      gap; nothing was wrong with the model). It came off anyway, because the reason
      to predict was cost and **the cost wasn't there**: timed on DQN, warm,
      `landmark_citers(limit=63)` took **22.08s** and `limit=None` — all **28,732**
      citers — took **22.28s**. The `LIMIT` saved **0.9%**; the scan, dedupe and
      200M-row papers join dominate either way, so the query had already paid for
      the pool and was discarding it. `budget.computed_cite_limit` now runs the STOP
      rule over the real years: DQN **63** where the model said 60, Hawking **176**
      where it said 160 — the model's own answer, minus ~21 mean absolute error.
      The trained model now serves **OpenAlex alone**, the one path whose pool would
      have to cross a network to be counted — exactly where
      [predict-vs-compute.md](predict-vs-compute.md) predicted it would end up.
      **Latest bands.** `bands.band_start_rule` is wired in, and the flat window is
      gone. On the real corpus: Hawking's bands start **2020** (7 bands, reaching
      back to meet a cluster dense to 2024), DQN's start **2023** (a tight 4-year
      frontier where the fixed span would have said 2020). One windowed DuckDB query
      (`ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY year …)`) does what OpenAlex needs one HTTP
      call per year for.
      **The subtle part, and Patrick's catch.** The first cut gave the corpus the
      *live* path's banded selector — 12 landmarks per year — on the reasoning that
      "compute, don't predict" implied "SKIP, not STOP". Two different claims: the
      0.9% measurement settles where the *number* comes from, not which *rule*
      applies, and the rule turns on the **pool's shape**. Patrick pushed back that
      he preferred the model's band, and was right twice over: banding forces
      `PER_YEAR_CAP` nodes out of *every* year (the best of a thin 1970 over the
      13th-best of a blockbuster year), and — by the verdict's own finding — it
      flattens the year distribution the tau rule reads, which would have **broken
      the Latest bands on this very path**. A prefix of a *whole-history* ranking is
      what a Field Landmark is; the live path bands only because its pool is a
      recency sliver with no all-time ranking to prefix. Same cap, same invariant,
      different pools, different rules.
      **What it cost to switch:** the s2 provider's landmark/latest split no longer
      means the same thing live vs corpus — a deliberately abandoned symmetry. The
      corpus and OpenAlex (both whole-history) now agree, and the live path is the
      odd one out because it structurally cannot join them.
- [x] **Live-path landmarks & Latest: the age-origin study — validated, and
      unneeded** *(v5.10.0's study; verdict 2026-07-17, no code change)* — Patrick's
      design to bring both trained models back to the live S2 fallback: (1) keep
      paging the reachable list, (2) run `cite_budget` with its **age origin at the
      oldest citer in the pool** rather than the seed (the truncated pool doesn't
      span the seed→now gap the seed-origin feature describes — DQN reads as a dense
      7-year history, not a 13-year classic), (3) let the model set the *total* only,
      with per-year banding still choosing *which* papers, (4) place the Latest band
      start with the `latest_gap` tau rule instead of a flat 12-month window. The
      ticket demanded it be **validated offline before wiring**, and stated its own
      null hypothesis up front: the live path already holds the pool, so the rule is
      computable, so the model may prove redundant. `ml_pipelines/live_pool_validation`
      simulated the exact reachable pool (newest 9,000 citers) for 58 seeds — 18 of
      them truncated — and ran both age origins against the rule computed exactly.
      **The verdict, in `research/live_pool_validation/analyze.ipynb`:**
      **Step 2 was right about the disease and wrong about the cure.** The seed
      origin *is* broken on truncated pools — **R² −0.707**, worse than predicting
      the mean — and moving the origin to the oldest reachable citer really does
      repair it, to **+0.446**. The diagnosis was correct. But the repaired model
      still misses by **41%** (MAE 25.5 against a label averaging 62.7) on a number
      the serve path can compute *exactly, for free, from memory*. So the null
      hypothesis held — not by the route it predicted (the model tracking the label
      so closely as to be redundant) but by a blunter one: predicting a computable
      quantity inherits error and saves nothing
      ([predict-vs-compute.md](predict-vs-compute.md), *a fortiori*). The sharpest
      form: **the age-origin repair fixes a distortion that only exists on truncated
      pools, and the only path with truncated pools is the one path that needs no
      model.** Correct, and nowhere to live.
      **Step 4 turned out unbuildable** — a finding the ticket's "eyeball the
      transfer rather than trusting it" caution earned. **56 of 58 seeds collapsed
      to a single-year Latest band**, and structurally so, twice over. First, step 3
      destroys what step 4 needs: `tail_edge` thresholds at `tau × the peak year's
      count`, but `select_up_to_cap_per_year` caps *every* year at 12 — so the peak
      **is** the cap, the threshold collapses to `0.25 × 12 = 3`, and any full year
      clears it instantly. Hawking's pool spans 1998–2026 and its selection is
      **exactly 348 = 29 × 12**; of the 23 seeds whose selection is exactly
      `12 × span`, **23 of 23** got a one-year band. Fed the app's own `tail_edge`, a
      flat 12/year shape returns 2026 where a top-N shape (what tau was *fit* on)
      returns 2020. Second and deeper: **a truncated pool has no recent tail to
      find** — it *is* the recent end, by definition. Steps 1 and 3 were already
      v5.5.0's shipped behavior, so the whole ticket resolved to **change nothing**.
      **Two things it left behind.** The tau rule *does* belong somewhere — the
      corpus path, which has real full-history distributions and still serves a flat
      12-month window (folded into the corpus-models ticket). And a finding neither
      ticket asked for: "exact" is a claim about arithmetic, not about the pool. The
      live path's computable label is exact about a sliver — VMD **12 against a
      full-history 166** (13.8×), median **1.8×** across the truncated seeds, and
      *Attention Is All You Need*'s newest 9,000 citers all sit in **one year**. The
      live path's real fix was never a better estimator; it's the offline corpus.

A reframe of the mega-paper citation story, decided with Patrick after we shelved
the stratified-sampling + velocity WIP. **Drop stratified offset windows
entirely.** One newest-≤1000 citation fetch does double duty, splitting citations
into two relations with distinct meaning, colour, filter, and (later) slider:

- **Landmark citations** (keep green `#4ade80`) — the most-cited papers citing the
  seed, "the giants that built on this." Reachable citation list ranked by citation
  count for normal papers; **mining-first** for mega papers (mine reachable citers'
  reference lists → verify → rank by citations, pruned to ≤ last year). No
  stratified windows → a mega build is ~3 S2 requests (1 fetch + 2 mining batches).
- **Latest citations** (NEW, light green `#86efac`) — citers from the **rolling
  last 12 months** (via `pub_date`), from the same fetch. "The frontier, right now."

- [x] **Single-source provider selector — the hybrid retired** *(v5.0.0 — major)* —
      a graph is now built from **one** academic-data backend, chosen per graph in
      the header's **"Data source"** dropdown (`Semantic Scholar` / `OpenAlex`),
      instead of the v4.x hybrid (S2 seed/refs/similar + OpenAlex citations merged
      with `max` counts and cross-source id dedup). Each provider stands alone:
      **S2** does seed/references/citations via S2 (its live citation API is
      newest-first + ~10k-offset capped, so Field Landmarks are the top-cited among
      the *recent* citer tip — a known interim bias, surfaced as a note in the graph
      controls and lifted later by the offline citations corpus); **OpenAlex** does
      the whole graph via server-sorted `cites:`/`cited_by:` queries (true top-cited
      landmarks, no ceiling — but a famous *published* seed resolves to its
      lower-cited arXiv-preprint record). Wins: **one citation-count scale** (node
      sizes finally comparable across relations), and the whole cross-source glue
      (`_upgrade_node` count-max, OA→S2 fallback, `_citation_relations`) deleted.
      OpenAlex grew the two pieces it was missing to stand alone — `references()`
      (a `cited_by:` filter) and `resolve_seed_work()` (arXiv id / `DOI:`/`ARXIV:`/
      `W…`). **Provider is part of the cache key** (`graph:<provider>:<seed>`, so an
      S2 and an OpenAlex graph for one paper never collide) and the **local cache
      search is provider-scoped** (a cached paper's "instant" badge is truthful only
      for the selected backend). `config.graph.default_provider` (`"s2"`) seeds the
      dropdown; the choice persists across Home and into a saved session. **Rolls up
      "Drop the Similar relation from the graph"** (below): the purple `similar`
      relation is off the built graph (chip + legend + build removed), the S2
      recommendations client kept only for the researcher's `expand_node`.
      *(Patrick's design; browser-tested 2026-07-13. Phase 1 of the provider work:
      the seed SEARCH and detail panel still hydrate via S2 for both providers —
      since shipped as v5.1.0, below.)*
- [x] **Adaptive latest-band boundary — a trained model sizes the Latest span
      per seed** *(v4.6.0)* — Field Landmarks are a seed's all-time most-cited
      citers (any year); *Latest Publications* fills recent years evenly, one
      `cited_by_count` query per year, from the band start **up to the current
      year** (this ship also **retired the separate newest-date window** — latest
      is now uniform per-year bands the whole way, so every recent year gets its
      own fair slice). The band's lower edge was a **fixed** `latest_band_years`
      offset (5 → start 2020). For an *old* seed whose landmark cluster tails off
      years before that, the timeline showed a dead stretch between the last
      landmark and the first band. Now the band start is chosen **per seed** from
      the recent edge of the landmark distribution: `citation_relations` hands the
      shipped landmarks' years to `bands.earliest_band_year`, which places the
      start at the **density tail edge** — the most recent year still holding ≥
      `tau` of the peak year's landmark count — floored by a `max_span` cost cap.
      No only-widen clamp, so a young seed whose cluster edge is recent gets a
      *tight* frontier too (Hawking → start 2020 / 7 bands; QMIX → 2024 / 3 bands).
      **Derived from data, not hand-tuned:** a new `ml_pipelines/latest_gap/`
      pipeline reuses the `cite_budget` seed sample, pulls each seed's
      shipped-landmark year distribution, and fits `tau` on **misdate-robustness**
      (**tau=0.25, max_span=7**; only ~1/64 seeds' boundary movable by a two-citer
      misdate), serialized to `ml_pipelines/models/latest_gap.joblib`; the app
      loads it in `services/graph/bands.py` and degrades to the fixed span when it
      can't. The rule is injected as a callable so `integrations/openalex` stays
      below `services`. Findings: **seed features can't predict the boundary** —
      a regression on age + log-citations (as `cite_budget` uses) scored a
      *negative* CV R²; and a **quantile is the wrong detector** — it's mass-based,
      so a large old bulk drags it years before the cluster's visible edge
      (Hawking's 0.85 quantile is 2013, but the cluster stays dense to ~2020). The
      density tail edge tracks where the count actually falls off.
      `research/latest_gap/analyze.ipynb` is the write-up. Config:
      `graph.adaptive_latest_band` (on by default). *(Backend heuristic; anchors
      eyeballed by Patrick, 2026-07-10.)*
- [x] **Adaptive landmark budget — a trained model sizes `cite_limit` per seed**
      *(v4.5.0)* — the flat landmark budget showed the same node count for every
      seed; now the ship count is **predicted from the seed's age + citation
      count**, so an old classic (Hawking) keeps a large, map-like set (~160)
      while a young, hot paper (DQN ~60, Attention ~30) gets a tight one — its
      top citers are same-era pile-on rather than a legible map. **Derived from
      data, not hand-tuned:** a new `ml_pipelines/cite_budget/` pipeline pulls
      ~60 OpenAlex seeds stratified by year × citations and labels each with its
      "density budget" n* — the longest citation-ranked citer **prefix** (first N
      from the top) before any single publication year floods past `K=12`, i.e.
      where temporal clutter sets in — then fits a scikit-learn
      `LinearRegression` (5-fold CV R²≈0.68), serialized to
      `ml_pipelines/models/cite_budget.joblib`. The app **loads the model** and
      calls `.predict()` per build (`services/graph/budget.py`), clamped to
      `[floor, cite_limit]`, sharing `compute_features` with training so there's
      no train/serve skew; a missing/broken artifact degrades to the flat
      `cite_limit`. `research/cite_budget/analyze.ipynb` is the exploratory
      write-up. Config: `graph.adaptive_cite_limit` (on by default; `cite_limit`
      is the ceiling). Finding: **age carries the signal** (r≈0.84); the "more
      citations → tighter budget" intuition didn't survive controlling for age
      (the citation term came out mildly *positive*). *(Backend heuristic;
      anchors eyeballed by Patrick, 2026-07-10.)*
- [x] **OpenAlex hybrid citation source** *(v4.0.0 — major; supersedes the
      S2 mining/stratified-sampling approach for citations)* — the culmination of
      the OpenAlex spike (below, now retired). **OpenAlex owns the citation
      relations; S2 keeps the seed resolve, references, *Similar*, and TL;DRs**,
      matched by DOI / arXiv id. A new `integrations/openalex/` package (client →
      nodes → traversal) mirrors `semantic_scholar/`; `services/graph/build.py`
      calls it via `_citation_relations`, **falling back to S2** when OpenAlex
      can't resolve the seed (so the graph is never worse). The whole S2
      landmark-**mining + verification** apparatus (`_mined_landmarks`,
      `_cites_seed`, `citation_mining` config) is **deleted** — OpenAlex's sorted
      `cites:` queries make it dead code. Highlights, each validated live and the
      graph now builds **far faster** (no deep-paging + 429 backoffs):
      - **Field Landmarks** = the all-time most-cited citers
        (`cites:<id>&sort=cited_by_count:desc`) — the historic giants, returned
        directly, no mining, edge guaranteed by the filter. Fixes the landmark
        recency bias at the root (Hawking's 1974 early band — Page '76,
        Gibbons–Hawking '77, Unruh '81 — surfaces immediately).
      - **Latest Publications** = recent citers: a newest-window query plus
        **per-year bands** (`latest_band_years`×`latest_per_year`) for even
        coverage, excluding anything that's already a landmark. The split
        self-adjusts per seed and leaves no gap between the relations.
      - **Split by publication YEAR, not exact date** — OpenAlex dating is coarse
        (year-only works default to `<year>-01-01`), so a rolling *date* window
        silently drops recent citers (DQN: 1 vs 30). See Bugs.
      - **Cross-source node identity** — OpenAlex citer nodes carry
        S2-resolvable ids (`DOI:` / `ARXIV:` / bare `W…`), so the existing paper
        routes hydrate their TL;DRs (via S2) and re-seed them unchanged.
      - **Metered pricing handled** — free API key $1/day, keyless $0.10/day,
        id/DOI lookups free; a per-seed build is a handful of filter calls.
        `OPENALEX_API_KEY` optional (`config.providers.openalex`). *(Browser-tested on
        hawking radiation / attention / dqn, 2026-07-09.)*
- [x] **Latest Publications slider reveals oldest-first** *(v4.1.0)* — the
      reveal slider used to surface the newest citers first and work *backward*
      into the banded years; inverted so rank 0 is the **oldest** banded-year
      paper and the slider walks forward through time toward the present
      (reads naturally left→right in Timeline). Selection is untouched — a
      `latest_limit` still keeps the **newest** N; only the shipped order of
      the survivors flips (pinned by a dedicated test). Backend-only (the
      slider is a pure `rank < value` reveal): the flip lives in the OpenAlex
      traversal **and** the S2 fallback, so both citation sources agree.
      *(Patrick's browser observation, 2026-07-09.)*
- [x] **Even citation spread across the years** *(v3.0.0 — supersedes "Recency
      preference for citations")* — instead of a user-facing older/newer knob,
      the seed's citations are now **always** selected **evenly across
      publication years**: the pool is bucketed by year (most-cited first
      within each) and round-robined, so sparse early years surface and no
      busy year monopolizes the count. For mega-cited seeds (beyond the
      1000-paper page), the pool is built by **stratified offset sampling**
      across S2's newest-first citation list (5 windows from the newest to the
      deepest reachable under S2's ~9k offset ceiling; windows S2 rejects
      degrade gracefully), so the spread covers the seed's whole descendant
      era instead of just the recent tip. No toggle shipped — even-by-year is
      simply how graphs build now (references keep the most-cited ranking; a
      reference list is naturally year-spread already). This is what gives
      "What's evolved since" a real timeline to narrate. **Known limit:** on
      truly mega-cited papers (≳10-20k citations, e.g. "Attention Is All You
      Need") the ~10k offset ceiling traps every stratum in the newest few
      months — see "Mega-paper citation coverage" below (since
      shipped as v3.1.0).
- [x] **Rank citations/references by citation count, not S2's default order**
      *(v2.1.1)* — a heavily-cited old seed (e.g. Hawking's "Black hole
      explosions?", 5,143 citations) was showing an almost entirely 2026,
      near-zero-citation "citations" neighborhood. Root cause: S2's
      `/paper/{id}/citations` and `/references` endpoints take no `sort` param
      and default to a genuinely chronological, newest-first order (confirmed
      by sampling `offset` across the full range) — so a small `cite_limit`
      filled up entirely with this year's obscure citing papers before a
      single famous one was ever seen. Fixed in `_neighbors()` (shared by
      `references()`/`citations()`): over-fetch up to S2's hard per-call cap
      (1000 — 1001+ returns HTTP 400) and rank the pool by `citation_count`
      locally before trimming to the configured limit. Verified against the
      Hawking paper: citing papers went from 0–1 citations each to 40–268.
      *Known limit (discussed and accepted):* a single call still only
      reaches ~1000 of the newest citations, so an extremely well-cited old
      paper's neighborhood still skews toward the last few years rather than
      spanning its full multi-decade citation history — truly reaching decades
      back would need a few extra stratified-`offset` calls per seed/expand,
      trading latency/API load for it. Shipping the single-call fix for now;
      revisit if the recency skew is still too tight in practice.
- [x] **Ship A — backend split + `latest` relation** *(v3.3.0)*. New `latest`
      edge type through `model.py`/`build.py`/counts; `citation_relations()`
      splits one newest-page fetch into mining-first landmark selection + a
      12-month `latest` partition (dropped the `_STRATA`/`_STRATUM_LIMIT`/
      `_MAX_OFFSET` sampling). Frontend: light-green colour + an on/off **filter
      chip** for latest (no slider — deferred to Ship C). **Mining hardened
      while testing:** budgets made operator-tunable (`graph.citation_mining.
      sources`/`.candidates`), candidate ranking switched from raw citations to
      **co-citation frequency** (so off-topic giants don't burn verification
      slots), and verification **chunked + best-effort per chunk** (survives a
      429, and `candidates` may exceed the 500-id batch cap). Flow documented in
      `integrations/semantic_scholar/README.md`. *Known ceiling: hyper-cited
      seeds (DQN ~16 landmarks) are capped by S2 truncating nested `references`
      arrays + the "invisible unless a source cites it" limit — see README.*
- [x] **Ship D — page deeper to complete the latest window + fill the landmark
      middle band** *(v3.4.0)*. `_fetch_citers(deep=True)` pages the citer list
      (offsets 0, 1000, 2000…), stopping at the first page with no in-window
      citer, the list end, or the `_MAX_OFFSET` (~10k) ceiling. `latest` now
      covers the *whole* rolling window; the citers just past the boundary fill
      the landmark middle band. **The stop-at-the-window half was retired in
      v5.5.0** — "the boundary page fills the middle band" held only while mining
      still supplied the real landmarks, and once v4.0.0 retired mining it left
      `landmark` living off one page of overshoot. See the v5.5.0 entry below and
      the Bugs entry "Field Landmarks were never landmarks". **Verified on DQN: ~3k citers paged, landmark
      relation went 16 → the full `cite_limit` (60) of real 2016–2024 citers,
      evenly spread.** For hyper-cited seeds (AIAYN) the past-ceiling tail still
      comes from mining — complementary. Graph expansion (`citations()`) stays
      one page. Paired **429 hardening**: `client.request` default `tries` 4 → 6
      (backoff to 16s) so a mega build's ~10 pages ride out sustained 429s;
      `min_interval` is the further lever. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-08.)*
- [x] **Ship B — "The current frontier" lecture** *(v3.5.0)*. New
      `LectureMode.FRONTIER` ("The current frontier"); `_story_nodes` scopes it to
      seed + any-relation nodes from the last ~12 months (absolute recency, not
      relative to the seed) — so it **folds in recent `similar` nodes too**,
      alongside the `latest` citers. `MODE_INTENTS` intent (survey the newest work
      as current threads, distinct from EVOLUTION's full arc), figure pool wired,
      frontend mode button + `LectureMode` type. Completeness guard added
      (`set(MODE_INTENTS) == set(LectureMode)`). **Window configurable since
      v4.2.0** (`frontier_window_months` lecturer extra, default ~5 years —
      see "Lecturer knobs" under AI teacher & lectures). **Rescoped in v4.8.0**
      to the `latest` relation only (no longer folds in `similar` nodes, and
      the window stopped filtering nodes — see "Lectures tightened" above).
- [x] **Ship C — live per-relation count sliders** *(v3.6.0)*. Each `Edge`
      carries a `rank` (its index in the relation's order — references/citations by
      influence, latest by recency, similar by S2); the backend ships the whole
      ranked set per relation (the `*_limit` config values became **ship counts =
      each slider's max**, and are now **nullable** — `null` ships *everything* the
      paper has, so the slider maxes to the full count) and the frontend slider is
      a **pure client-side reveal** of `rank < value`, defaulting to 25, no
      re-query. UI: a clean aligned grid (dot+label toggle · slider · `N/max`) —
      references/**Field Landmarks**/**Latest Publications**/**Similar** (chip
      relabel folded in). The **agent-grounding fix** rode along (it had to —
      sliders hide nodes, so grounding is now visible ∪ discoveries, via
      `visibleNodeIds`). Salvaged the slider UI + `rank`/grounding mechanics from
      `stash@{0}`; dropped its `pool_limit` cap per the new design. *(Slider from
      the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-06; fetch-everything + relabel + nullable limits
      2026-07-08.)*

  **→ Phase complete (A → D → B → C shipped, v3.3.0–v3.6.0).** The mega-paper
  citation story is now: deep-paged landmark/latest split, co-citation mining for
  the past-ceiling tail, a current-frontier lecture, and live per-relation
  sliders over the whole ranked pool.

  - **Shelved WIP — `stash@{0}`** ("WIP v3.3.0-candidate: velocity reveal-order +
    configurable citation_pool …"), sitting on top of the earlier
    sliders/grounding/clutter stash — **superseded by the plan above** but kept
    for cherry-picking. Reusable bits: the **agent-grounding fix** (`GraphExplorer`
    publishes `visibleNodesSet`; `selectGroundingNodes` → visible ∪ discoveries —
    was browser-verified), the **clutter retune** (Timeline day-of-year spread via
    `withinYearFraction`), the **pool_limit/rank slider mechanism** (for Ship C),
    and a **`_velocity` helper** (`citation_count / (age + 1)`). Patrick chose to
    keep the grounding fix + clutter retune out of Ship A for now — revisit.
- [x] **Mega-paper citation coverage — beat the ~10k offset ceiling**
      *(v3.1.0)* — the
      v3.0.0 even-by-year citation spread has a known blind spot on truly
      mega-cited papers. S2's `/citations` endpoint returns citing papers
      **newest-first**, offers **no server-side sort**, and **rejects any
      request past `offset + limit` ≈ 10k** (hence `_MAX_OFFSET = 9000` in
      `_stratified_pool`). The stratified fetch can therefore only sample
      inside the newest ~9.2k citations — for **"Attention Is All You Need"
      (~150k citations, tens of thousands per year)** that's the top ~6% of
      the list, i.e. the last few months, so every stratum lands in 2026 and
      the even-by-year selection has exactly one year-bucket to spread over.
      Even a landmark 2019 citer (BERT-class famous) sits ~100k entries deep
      — S2 will simply never return it through this endpoint. (DQN at ~15k
      citations is only partly affected: offset 9000 reaches ~60% of its
      list, back to the mid-2010s, but its oldest citers are past the
      ceiling too.) **Decided design — the heuristic as a pool-builder, not
      a replacement.** The final even-by-year selection stays (pure
      most-popular would re-clump in the hot years, losing the frontier);
      the heuristic only enriches the *pool* it selects from. Three-tier
      dispatch in `citations()`: **≤1000** citations → single page (the
      complete list, exact); **1k–ceiling** → stratified offset windows
      (unchanged); **past the ceiling** → stratified windows for the
      reachable slice PLUS **landmark mining**: harvest the reference lists
      of the pool's most-cited recent citers (surveys are goldmines — they
      cite every landmark), rank candidates by their own citation count, and
      **verify each candidate actually cites the seed** before keeping it —
      a candidate merely co-appearing in reference lists is NOT proof, and
      the graph must never invent a citation edge (verification via one
      batched `references.paperId` lookup). Verified landmarks join the pool
      (influential flag unknowable → False) and even-by-year does the rest:
      BERT-class 2018-2020 landmarks AND the 2026 frontier, honestly edged.
      Mining is best-effort — either batch failing just degrades to the
      reachable pool, never fails the build. (A first cut also carried a
      `deep_citations` retry mode and adaptive client pacing, built against
      one congested S2 night; the congestion turned out to be transient, so
      both were dropped as overkill — the ship is mining + stratified
      windows + even-by-year, nothing more.)
      Alternatives kept on file: year-filtered citation queries *if* S2 ever
      adds them (trivial then), or the S2 Datasets bulk dump (full
      enumeration, but against the "no local corpus" philosophy). *(From a
      live v3.0.0 session on 1706.03762, 2026-07-07; design settled same
      day.)*
- [x] **The s2 live fallback's Field Landmarks made honest** *(v5.5.0 — minor)*.
      The s2 provider's live citer path (used whenever the offline corpus can't
      resolve a seed) was shipping a landmark relation that wasn't one: on DQN,
      2024–2025 LLM-agent surveys led by a 394-cite *Trust in AI*. Four compounding
      causes, each fixed (full stories in **Bugs**):
      - **The pager stopped at the `latest` window**, not the ceiling — so the
        landmark ranking got a 1999-citer pool covering two years while the
        reachable list runs back to **2019** with 7999. It now pages the whole
        list; `latest` is unchanged, cold builds cost more (QMIX 4 pages / ~8s,
        DQN 9 / ~15s). `_MAX_OFFSET` 9000 → **8000** (S2 400s a page whose window
        reaches ~10k; verified live), so the reachable pool is ~9k, not 10k.
      - **The cite-budget model was serving a pool it wasn't trained on** — its
        label came from OpenAlex's whole-history rankings, so it read DQN's age and
        sized for landmarks spanning decades that a ceiling-truncated pool doesn't
        have (63 predicted, 29 admitted). The live path now **selects from the pool
        it already holds** (`budget.density_selection`) instead of predicting; the
        model still serves the ranked paths (OpenAlex, corpus), where it's valid.
      - **A count can't express the answer.** The density rule is a *prefix* — one
        dense year ends the walk — so 2020 filling at rank 29 stranded 2024–2025
        entirely, leaving an 18-month hole before the Latest frontier. The
        selection **bands the ranking per year** (≤`DENSITY_CAP` each, skip the
        full ones): 84 landmarks across 2019–2025, same "no year over the cap"
        guarantee, no hole. It's the local equivalent of OpenAlex's per-year query
        bands — S2's `/citations` has no year filter, so it happens over the
        ranking. `density_budget` stays as the model's training label (a regression
        label has to be a scalar) and moved into `services/graph/budget.py` beside
        the features, with `ml_pipelines/cite_budget` importing both back.
      - **Date-poor papers got a guaranteed quota.** Undated citers are dropped
        rather than bucketed, `_is_latest`/`_latest_order` fall back to `year` when
        S2 gives no date (a post-cutoff year is frontier, not history), and
        Timeline filters undated papers out of the view. Killed both vertical
        lines. Result on DQN: 84 landmarks, 2019–2025, led by CQL, Decision
        Transformer, Dota 2. *Still ceiling-bound:* 2013–2018 (AlphaGo, A3C,
        Rainbow) is unreachable live at any page count — the corpus's job.

- [x] **Phase 2 — provider choice extended to search + detail** *(v5.1.0)* —
      v5.0.0's selector governed the *graph build only*; now picking **OpenAlex**
      is coherent end-to-end. **Seed search** has an OpenAlex path
      (`openalex.search_papers` — `search=` relevance over title/abstract/fulltext,
      year window as `from/to_publication_date`), with **provider-aware copy**
      (the hit list reads "Searching **OpenAlex**…" / "From **OpenAlex**"), and the
      local cache search already scoped per provider (v5.0.0). **Detail hydration**
      comes from the graph's provider (`openalex.get_paper` — abstract from the
      inverted index, **topic tags** from `topics`, no TL;DR so the panel shows the
      abstract; the panel's field-tag heading is provider-aware); OpenAlex nodes
      hydrate **by their node id** (the reliable `DOI:`/`W…` form — a bare arXiv id
      can miss a published paper's canonical OA record). **Field filter** is now a
      real, per-provider control: a new **OpenAlex field taxonomy** (`openalex.vocab`,
      the 26 top-level fields) served by `/api/taxonomy/openalex` in a unified
      `{id, name}` shape (S2's picker adopts it too), the picker refetches per
      provider, and OA search filters by `topics.field.id`. **The `arxiv` taxonomy
      provider was retired** (dead — it fed the long-gone arXiv-category search
      filter; `arxiv.vocab.groups()`/`valid_codes()` deleted, `name_for` kept for
      the detail-panel tags). *Deferred (its own ticket below): making the
      researcher's `expand_node`/`search_papers` tools provider-aware — still
      S2-only.* *(Patrick's asks incl. the OA field taxonomy + arxiv-taxonomy
      removal; browser-tested 2026-07-13.)*
- [x] **Provider-aware researcher tools** *(v5.2.0)* — the Q&A researcher's
      `expand_node` (references/citations/similar hops), `search_papers`, and its
      lazy detail hydration now follow the **selected graph provider** instead of
      always hitting S2 — so an OpenAlex graph stays OpenAlex end to end (no more
      S2-paperId nodes pulled onto an OpenAlex graph). `agents/traversal.py`'s
      `neighbors`/`search` branch per provider (OpenAlex resolves the node id →
      work, then `cited_by:`/`cites:`; the **similar** hop uses OpenAlex
      **`related_works`** — its concept/citation-overlap neighbors, weaker than
      S2's SPECTER2 but the closest analogue, chosen over a graceful degrade).
      Provider is in the traversal cache keys and threads
      `route → orchestrator.run → researcher.answer → ResearcherDeps.provider →
      the tools`; the frontend sends `provider` on `/api/ask`. *(Patrick's ask;
      browser-tested 2026-07-13.)*
- [x] **Phase 3 — S2 citations corpus (the real Field-Landmarks fix for S2)**
      *(v5.4.0)* — option **(b)** from `docs/citation-coverage.md`, shipped as a
      corpus-**optional** pipeline in `integrations/semantic_scholar/corpus/`. The
      bulk **`citations`** (2.4B edges, ~255GB) + **`papers`** (200M, ~45GB)
      Datasets releases are downloaded (resumable, checkpointed, signed-URL-expiry
      aware) and ingested via **DuckDB → Parquet**: papers projected + arXiv-indexed,
      citations **hash-partitioned on `citedcorpusid`** so a single seed's citer
      lookup reads ~1/1024 of the edge list. The app queries its own copy through a
      small **`CitationSource`** seam (`landmark_citers`/`latest_citers`) — a
      **`DuckDBCitationSource`** now, the **Athena-over-S3** impl (the AWS Airflow
      endgame) later behind the same two methods. `build.py::_traverse_s2` prefers
      the corpus (landmarks **citation-sorted across all history** — the ranking the
      live ~10k-offset endpoint can't give) and falls back to the recency-biased
      live path when the corpus is absent or can't resolve the seed. Operator
      workflow via the **`astronaut corpus`** CLI (`status`/`download`/`ingest`/`activate`);
      corpus root is `config.storage.s2_corpus_dir` (gitignored, outside the repo).
      Which path served a build is on `Graph.citation_source` and surfaced in the UI
      (the Field-Landmarks note reads "offline citations corpus" vs the live caveat),
      plus a DEBUG build log. *(Patrick's plan, filed 2026-07-13; shipped 2026-07-15.)*
- [x] **Corpus ingest made viable — the partition-limit fix + a split parquet root**
      *(v5.6.0 — minor)*. Ingesting the first full release surfaced two things. The
      **bug**: DuckDB's `partitioned_write_max_open_files` defaults to **100** while
      we partition into **1024** buckets, so it cycled partitions open/closed and —
      Parquet being unappendable once closed — started a *new file* each time. One
      shard → ~21k files at **3.5 KB** (nearly all footer), ~8M projected for the
      release; file *creation*, not throughput, was the bottleneck (2.8 min/shard,
      ~18h projected; listing the output dir timed out). `_connect()` now raises the
      limit past `NBUCKETS` and stops pinning `threads=8`/`memory_limit=8GB` *below*
      DuckDB's own machine-sized defaults (16 / 25 GiB), which its docstring already
      claimed it wanted. Measured: **1024 files/shard, one per bucket, at 61 KB.**
      The **design point**: `raw/` is ~400 GB read exactly once, sequentially (fine
      on a spinning disk), while the Parquet is the queried working set and takes
      the ~400k partitioned writes — 20.6s/shard on NVMe vs 98.2s on an SMR HDD. New
      optional **`config.storage.s2_corpus_parquet_dir`** puts the halves on
      different drives (null = today's layout, and the right answer once one fast
      drive holds everything); `paths.release_paths()` wires both roots so a
      hand-built `ReleasePaths` can't silently ignore the split, and `corpus status`
      prints both. Full stories in **Bugs**; the residual O(n²) scaling and the
      `activate`-only-checks-papers hole are filed in the OnePager Backlog. *(Found while ingesting
      the 2026-07-07 release, 2026-07-15.)*
- [x] **Corpus citers deduped — S2 ships every edge twice** *(v5.6.1 — patch)*.
      The `2026-07-07` citations release is **two overlapping export batches** (240
      shards `…_00151_3g69z_…` + 150 `…_00016_bxc9g_…`, exactly as S2's API lists
      them): 5.1B rows for ~2.7B distinct edges. So `landmark_citers(limit=63)`
      counted **rows, not papers**, and DQN's 63-landmark budget bought ~32 — the
      right papers, half the graph. `source._citers` now groups by `citingcorpusid`
      before the join and the limit, `bool_or`-ing `isinfluential` (the batches
      disagree). Can't be done at ingest: a duplicate pair spans two shards, so a
      per-shard `DISTINCT` never sees both copies. The synthetic fixture now ships an
      overlapping second batch the way S2 does, so the plain landmark assertions fail
      if the dedupe is removed. Full story in **Bugs → Upstream**. *(Found right after
      the first full corpus went live, 2026-07-16.)*
- [x] **The corpus's two roots, named for what they hold** *(v5.7.0 — minor;
      **breaking config change**)*. v5.6.0's split bolted a second path onto a flat
      key: `s2_corpus_dir` + `s2_corpus_parquet_dir`. The first name stopped being
      true the moment the second existed — it reads "the corpus root" but meant
      "wherever the shards live, plus the pointer", with the Parquet a bolt-on.
      Now they're peers under one group, each named for its contents:
      ```json
      "storage": { "s2": { "raw": "E:\\s2corpus", "parquet": "D:\\s2corpus" } }
      ```
      matching how `providers.s2` / `llm.providers` already group. **`CURRENT` moved
      to the parquet root** — it names an *ingested* release, so it belongs beside
      the data it points at, and the payoff is real: the parquet root is now the
      app's **only serving dependency**, so shards can be deleted (or their drive
      pulled) and graph builds carry on. Previously serving needed both drives just
      to read a one-line pointer. `download.json` likewise sits with the shards it
      tracks. `paths` gains `raw_root()`/`parquet_root()`; `ReleasePaths` takes both
      and **raises** on an unconfigured half rather than defaulting to the other —
      silently defaulting is how Parquet once got written to a drive nobody asked
      for. `corpus status` prints both roots and a per-release `shards=` column, so
      "downloaded but not ingested" and "ingested, shards deleted" are both legible.
      **Breaking:** an old `config.json` fails validation loudly (`extra="forbid"`)
      rather than silently losing the corpus — the right trade. *(Patrick's call on
      the shape, 2026-07-16.)*
- [x] **Duplicate nodes for the same paper (cross-source identity)**
      *(v4.5.1)* — Patrick's browser observation: seeding on DQN showed two
      instances of "Continuous control with deep RL". Investigation found it
      was actually **three** (an OpenAlex `ARXIV:` citer + an OpenAlex
      `DOI:` citer from a duplicate work + an S2-paperId similar hit), and
      24/11/43/30 duplicate-title groups across the four cached graphs. Fix:
      **node identity resolves through the arXiv id** in
      `build.py::add_neighbor` — the one id both sources agree on — with
      `add_neighbor` returning the canonical id for edges, later sightings
      upgrading fields they know better (`_upgrade_node`: max
      `citation_count`, since S2's counts are far more complete; fill-if-None
      for summary/date fields), `add_edge` skipping self-loops + duplicate
      `(source, target, type)` triples, ranks staying compact, and `counts`
      becoming post-dedupe edge counts. The seed registers its own arXiv id,
      so a citer that IS the seed under another id merges instead of
      self-looping. Known residual (deliberate): a journal-DOI record vs.
      its preprint twin where neither carries the arXiv id can't merge —
      title matching was rejected as too risky (same-title distinct papers
      exist, e.g. Living Reviews editions). Two pinned tests. *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-10.)*
- [x] **Verify slider reveal order is most-cited-first** *(2026-07-10 —
      verified correct, no fix needed)* — audited all four cached graph
      snapshots (DQN, Attention, QMIX, Hawking; up to 500 edges/relation):
      **references and Field Landmarks reveal perfectly most-cited-first**
      (zero rank inversions everywhere), **Latest Publications is perfectly
      date-ascending** (the v4.1.0 oldest-first reveal, zero inversions),
      and **Similar reveals by S2 similarity** — not citations — which is
      that relation's intended semantics (most-similar first); Patrick
      accepted this as correct. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-09.)*
- [x] **Prune ghost similar papers (no citations AND no publication history)**
      *(v4.10.2)* — S2 recommendations that carry **zero citations AND no
      year/date** are unverifiable noise, so they're dropped from the *similar*
      relation at build time (`build._is_ghost_similar`, in the recommendation
      loop) — before the node and before the `similar` count, so the slider's
      pool stays honest. Both conditions are required (any citations, or any
      year/`pub_date`, keeps the paper); the prune is scoped to `similar` only,
      never to a verified reference/citation/latest link. Pinned by a
      boundary-case unit test on the helper plus a build-level test that a ghost
      is dropped while a cited-but-dateless and a dated-but-uncited
      recommendation stay. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-10.)*

### Saved sessions & workspaces

- [x] **Threads — one thread, one graph** *(v7.22.0)* — the conversation model gets a
      second level: an **exploration** holds **threads**, and a thread owns
      exactly one graph (or none). This replaces the cross-graph band-aids
      that v7.21.0 was still stacking up — the greyed `[n]` chips, the
      bubble-that-stops-being-a-control, the provenance line that reloads a
      graph *under* the conversation — with a structure where the problem
      can't arise. *(Design pass with Codex and Claude, 2026-09-14; Patrick's
      call. The summary below is what was settled and what wasn't.)*

      **The problem.** Since v7.10.0 a graph load keeps the transcript, so one
      conversation can hold turns grounded in several graphs. Every fix since
      has been a *negative* signal — this chip points nowhere, this bubble
      re-lights nothing — plus a click on the provenance line to swap the
      graph back under an unrelated conversation. Patrick: *"this feels a bit
      clunky."* It is: the interface treats the graph currently on screen as
      the authority on whether an old answer is usable, when the answer's
      validity never changed. And the softer fixes (a thread that *can* hold
      several graphs, a graph open that *doesn't* create a thread) all
      recreate the same problem one level down — Patrick spotted that, and it
      is what makes the rule below hard rather than advisory.

      **Decided.**

      - **Exploration → General + graph threads.** Every exploration opens
        with a graphless **General** thread (its name stays *General*):
        paper searches and "what's new in quantum computing" live there.
        *Explore* on a result spawns a graph thread. Graph threads are titled
        by the seed's short title; exploration titles describe the goal and
        keep today's first-request titling. Both renamable; no automatic
        re-title prompts.
      - **A thread owns its transcript and its graph state.** Opening another
        graph switches to the thread that owns it, or creates one. Filtering,
        selecting and expanding stay inside the thread — the graph only ever
        *grows*, so every paper a turn cites is on that thread's graph by
        construction. **Paper citations highlight the current graph**;
        graph icons open or resume the paper's graph thread directly. No
        intermediate paper-details modal. *(Patrick's browser-review correction,
        2026-09-15: preserve the two existing citation actions and glyphs.)*

      - **This reverses v7.10.0's keep-the-transcript decision**, on purpose.
        Keeping the conversation across graph loads was right when there was
        one conversation; the continuity it protected now lives in the
        exploration. Record the reversal in `docs/history.md` next to the
        original when this ships.
      - **The band-aids are deleted, not polished.** `onGraphIds`
        (`useConversation.ts:176`, fed by `selectWorkspaceNodeIds` — note it
        checks *loaded* nodes, not filter visibility, so filters never greyed
        anything), the `cite-ref` inert state, the whole-bubble control check
        (`Teacher.tsx:641`), `BeatList`'s on-graph set, and the clickable
        provenance line all go. The *"Make the provenance line a control"*
        ticket (UI & rendering polish) is superseded — see the note on it.
      - **The unit already exists.** Today's `SessionData`
        (`frontend/src/api/sessions.ts:176` — one `seed`, one `graph_ref`,
        one `nodes`/`edges`, one `chat`) *is* the thread record, near-verbatim.
        The exploration is a new thin record: title, summary, ordered thread
        ids. The transcript slice already keys conversations
        (`store/transcript.ts` — a stream writes into the conversation that
        started it whether or not it is on screen); that keying moves from
        exploration to thread and the background-stream story carries over.
      - **History is client-owned** — see the *"Lecture turns never reach
        the researcher as history"* ticket (Teacher & agent reach). Do that
        first; under threads, history = the thread's chat, full stop, and the
        two server-side dicts have no place left to stand.
      - **Cross-thread context is deliberate and bounded.** Two mechanisms:
        (1) a **sibling index** in every thread's prompt — each other thread's
        title plus a one-paragraph summary, regenerated when the thread's
        `chat.length` has moved past a stored `summarizedThrough` at the
        same "conversation has settled" moment the autosave already detects
        (no timers); (2) **`@thread` mentions** in the composer, reusing
        `mentions/` the way papers are mentioned, inlining that thread's
        summary plus its last `history_turns` turns — the budget already in
        `config.json`, reused rather than a new knob. A `read_thread` agent
        tool is the later step if summaries prove too thin.
      - **The composer names its subject** — *"Asking about PPO · 18 papers"*
        — so the next message's thread is never ambiguous; a message always
        goes to the active thread.

      **Migration — old saves stay recoverable.** A pre-threads save becomes
      one exploration. Its turns split into threads keyed by the assistant
      turn's `ChatMsg.graph` stamp (`sessions.ts:98`, present since v7.21.0):
      `seedId` + `provider ?? save.provider` (the stamp's `provider` is
      optional on the first turns that carried it). A user turn travels with
      the assistant turn that follows it, so pairs stay intact. Unstamped turns
      (pre-v7.21.0) stay in the thread the save's own `seed` names — those
      saves were overwhelmingly one graph — and get no stamp invented.
      Migrate lazily on load and write back on the next save, the pattern the
      legacy-save fields already follow, so opening an old exploration never
      rewrites it by itself.

      **Open.**

      - **Thread navigation layout.** A rail beside the transcript? Tabs above
        the composer? The exploration list in `shell/SideBar.tsx` already
        reads like a chat history; threads either nest under it or live in
        the assistant panel. This is the real design work left.
      - **What "settled" means for the summary refresh** when a thread has a
        stream running in the background — probably the same signal the
        autosave waits on, but check that a lecture's beats count.
      - **`@thread` mention rendering** in the sent message and in history —
        the mentioned thread's turns need a visible source label in the prompt
        (*"from the DQN thread:"*) so the model, and the reader looking at the
        trace, can tell borrowed context from the thread's own.

      **Shipped decisions.** Threads nest under exploration carets and reuse
      the existing row typography, Rename/Delete menu and inline rename.
      General is permanent. Summaries refresh after completed transcript changes
      with no active stream; sibling context is labelled separately and bounded.
      Paper citations retain highlighting, while graph icons open/resume a thread
      directly. Autosaves serialize all threads and preserve background work;
      a browser-close outbox recovers interrupted writes. Patrick approved the
      browser-tested result on 2026-09-15.



- [x] **Every exploration saves itself, and several can run at once**
      *(v7.16.0)* — the Save button is gone. Saving was a manual ＋ in the rail,
      and forgetting it lost the sitting on tab close; explorations now save
      themselves, arrive in the rail named after what you asked, and keep
      working when you switch away from them.

      **The vocabulary moved with the behaviour**: *graph* → **exploration**,
      starting with ✎ New Exploration. An exploration is a sitting at the app —
      the conversation, the lectures, and a note of which graph was open.

      **An exploration stores the conversation, not the graph** (Patrick's
      call, 2026-08-29, made against the recommendation and worth recording as
      his). The blob carries a `graph_ref` and the reopen rebuilds — instantly
      while the 1-day snapshot cache is warm, from the provider when it is not.
      The cost is real and was accepted knowingly: a cold reopen spends
      rate-limited calls, and the rebuilt graph can differ from the one you
      left as citation data moves. **The agent's discoveries are the one
      exception and *are* stored** — no cache holds them and no rebuild
      reproduces them, because they are a product of the conversation rather
      than of the seed.

      **A graphless conversation is now a first-class exploration.** Since the
      landing chat became the front door a reader could hold a long
      conversation before any graph existed, and `POST /api/sessions` 400'd on
      an empty `nodes` list — so closing the tab threw it away. That was the
      data loss the whole ticket existed to end, and the route's validation was
      the thing enforcing it.

      **Conversations run in parallel.** `transcript` held exactly one, which
      is *why* switching exploration had to abort whatever was streaming: a
      running answer had nowhere to write but whatever was now on screen. It is
      keyed by exploration now, every action takes an optional key as its
      second argument (`meta.key`; omitted, it means the active one — so the
      ~30 dispatches about what the reader is looking at stayed unkeyed and
      unchanged, and only the streaming paths had to think about it). Ask
      something slow, go read another exploration, come back to a finished
      answer; the rail marks the ones still working. Discoveries are the piece
      that cannot simply follow — the workspace holds only the active graph, so
      an off-screen find waits in its own conversation rather than landing on
      the map being read.

      **Naming, once.** The first save asks the summarizer for a title from the
      conversation — a second entry point on that agent's id rather than a
      sixth agent in Settings. Once, because it costs a call *and* because the
      reader may have renamed the row; it is its own route rather than a step
      inside the save, since model latency has no business on a path that fires
      every two seconds. A null title is a 200, not an error: the fallback is
      the reader's own first message, and a save must never fail over a nicety.

      **Answers that never arrive now say so**, on the turn rather than in
      panel state — the commonest failure is a run the reader *left*, and a
      message in component state is gone by the time they look. **Try again**
      re-runs the question, dropping the failed exchange and sending the
      conversation with it (used only when the server's in-memory history is
      empty, which after a reload it always is). The **tool trace collapses
      itself** when a run finishes, with a caret, and a reader's own click wins
      from then on.

      Two smaller defects surfaced with it and are fixed here: a chip could
      keep spinning under a header that had already gone back to `2 steps`
      (a run dying mid-step leaves `pending` set, which only the *finished*
      trace clears — now settled in the store the moment a run ends, not just
      at save time), and the turn reported the generic "stopped before it
      finished" where the backend had said something specific, because the
      real message arrives on the SSE `error` frame rather than as an
      exception.

      **Verified in the browser, and that is where five of the bugs came
      from** — all four in `bugs.md`, including one that destroyed a finished
      answer during testing. Their common shape is worth carrying forward: a
      save is a **whole-blob overwrite**, so every staleness bug on this path is
      a data-loss bug. The invariants that came out of it — an id and its
      content move together; a save never writes less than it last wrote;
      nothing on an unload path awaits what it need not — are recorded in
      `shell/README.md` beside the code that has to keep them.
      *(Filed 2026-08-25; built and browser-tested 2026-08-29 → 2026-09-01.)*

- [x] **Phase 4 — Saved sessions & workspaces** *(v1.15.0)* — persistence,
      deliberately dropped at the v1.0 pivot, reintroduced as opt-in. A **🗂
      Sessions drawer** saves the current workspace — the full graph as it stands
      (every node/edge, **including the papers the agent discovered / expanded /
      searched in**, with their flags), the layout mode, and the teacher
      transcript (chat + lecture beats + history trace) — into a dedicated
      persistent store (`sessions.py`, `data/sessions.db`; own lifecycle, never
      TTL-evicted). Reopening rebuilds the graph **directly from the save — no
      Semantic Scholar rebuild**, so a restore costs zero rate-limited calls and
      the exact discovered papers come back; the teacher remounts with the saved
      conversation (restored answers/beats still re-light their nodes on click).
      **Save-as-new** or **Update** an existing session in place (overwrite by id),
      plus delete. Shipped with the bundled lighter control: **clear chat on
      demand** — a **Clear** button in the teacher header, and re-seeding via
      "Explore from here" now auto-starts a fresh conversation (the panel remounts
      per graph). New routes `GET/POST /api/sessions`, `GET/DELETE
      /api/sessions/<id>`. *(Known limit: the server-side Q&A memory is ephemeral,
      so a follow-up after reopening starts without the earlier turns as context —
      it still answers against the fully restored graph. Deliberately left as-is.)*

### UI & rendering polish

- [x] **Modals and folding sections animate, and the graph controls fold
      into a sliders button** *(v8.10.0)* — step (4) of the "Animate the rest
      of the UI" order, plus the controls icon from the `todos.md` inbox.
      **Modals** (Settings, Library, the figure lightbox): the backdrop dims in
      while the card rises a few pixels from just under full size, and both run
      back on close; the backdrop owns the exit (its own `animationend` is what
      `usePresence` waits for). The lightbox became always-rendered with a
      nullable `figure`, holding the last one while it fades. **Folding
      sections** — a turn's "N steps" trace, a lecture's beats, the Settings
      groups — go through a new `ui/Fold`: a one-cell grid whose row animates
      `0fr` ↔ `1fr`, i.e. to the content's real height, which `height: auto`
      can't do. It animates only on a *change* (a fold that mounts open just
      appears, or a restored conversation would unfold every trace at once),
      clips only while moving, and has a `keepMounted` mode for the beats,
      which hold their loaded figures. First pass was too quick (240/120ms);
      Patrick asked for a little slower, so folds got their own
      `--motion-fold` (340ms) and `--motion-fold-exit` (260ms). **The graph
      controls** started in `Fold` too and showed the bug that retired their
      collapsed bar: collapsing switched `.controls` to `width: auto` while the
      body was still folding, and for a few frames auto meant the widest
      unwrapped row — the panel ballooned before it closed. Now collapsed is a
      rounded-square **sliders button** (`SlidersGlyph`, drawn inline in
      `currentColor` — Patrick's reference was a stock image, used only for the
      idea), matching the assistant's reopen button; the panel pops out of its
      corner and fades back into it, staying in the DOM behind `hidden` for the
      tour's existence checks, and only the *visible* control carries
      `data-tour="controls-head"`. The paper-count readout that rode the old
      bar now lives in the open panel's footer only. *(Browser-tested and
      approved by Patrick, 2026-10-06.)*

- [x] **The docked panels slide, and the graph glides with them**
      *(v8.9.0)* — step (3) of the "Animate the rest of the UI" order. The
      detail panel and the assistant used to appear and vanish in one frame,
      snapping the canvas to its new width. **They slide rather than
      squeeze:** a panel keeps its full width (`--panel-width`, fed inline
      from its resizable width) and a negative `margin-right` pulls it past
      the edge (`panel-in` / `panel-out`, `index.css`), so its text never
      reflows mid-motion, while the canvas — `flex: 1`, followed by
      `GraphExplorer`'s ResizeObserver — grows by exactly that margin each
      frame. `.shell-body` clips on x with `overflow-x: clip` (not `hidden`:
      no scroll container, and vertical overflow is untouched). **The detail
      panel** goes through `ui/usePresence`, holding the last paper while it
      slides out (the selection is already null by then); it emerges from
      behind the assistant, which follows it in the row and paints on top,
      and switching papers keeps the element, so nothing replays. **The
      assistant** can't unmount — that is what keeps the conversation — so
      the hook only delays `.collapsed` (`display: none`) until the
      slide-out has played, and the slide-in is tied to the *reopen*
      (`reopening`, set when `collapsed` flips false), never to the class,
      so a panel arriving with its graph is left to the graph's entrance
      (step 6). The ↩ reopen button pops in where the panel left. 280ms
      (`--motion-panel`), longer than a popover because the canvas travels
      too. *(Browser-tested and approved by Patrick, 2026-10-06.)*

- [x] **Popovers, menus and the find bar move — both ways — and the data
      source picker opens on one click** *(v8.8.0)* — steps (1) and (2) of
      the "Animate the rest of the UI" order, plus a bug fix.
      **One motion language:** the entrance curves and the `rise`/`fade`
      keyframes moved from `teacher.css` (where only the chat could reach
      them, and where the find bar's borrowed `fade` would have broken the
      day the panel's stylesheet stopped loading first) to `:root` in
      `index.css`, joined by `--motion-pop` (160ms), `--motion-morph`
      (240ms) and `--motion-exit` (120ms — leaving should never make the
      reader wait). **Popovers and menus** — filters, `@` suggestions,
      source scope, the ⋯ row menu, the collapsed data-source menu — open
      with a fade and a slight scale from the edge they hang off (each sets
      its `transform-origin`), and close by the same move run back. **The
      find bar** unfolds out of its 🔍 (a `clip-path` that starts as the
      button's own 34px circle and opens leftward), folds back into it, and
      the 🔍 pops in after. **Exits needed new plumbing:** React unmounts the
      instant `open` drops, so nothing could animate out. `ui/usePresence`
      holds a closing element mounted with `.closing` until its *own*
      `animationend` (the event bubbles; a child's fade must not end the
      parent's exit), skips the exit where none can play (reduced motion; no
      animation engine — jsdom), and falls back on a 600ms timer. Exits are
      their own keyframes, never the entrance reversed — an animation only
      restarts when its name changes. The `@` panel fades over the last list
      actually on screen, because its hook clears the results in the render
      that closes it. Patrick's ask for the exits came out of the browser
      round: *"closing them should also fade out."* **The data-source fix**
      is in [docs/bugs.md](docs/bugs.md). *(Order picked 2026-10-06;
      browser-tested and approved the same day.)*

- [x] **The app wears the favicon's palette** *(v8.7.0)* — the app around
      the helmet mark used none of its colours: a grey-black page and a
      generic blue accent. **Dark** now takes the mark wholesale — the
      helmet's night navy (`#0b1524`) as the page with panels lifted a step
      above it, its ivory shell as strong text, and the visor rim's glass
      blue (`#6fb6ce`) as the accent; filled controls use `#2f7f9c`, the
      glass blue darkened until white on it clears 4.5:1 (the old blue
      managed 3.68). **Light took three browser rounds.** An ivory page (the
      shell colour) read as dingy — warm grey under the question bubbles —
      so the neutrals went back to the cool `#f5f6f8` and only the ink and
      accent took the palette. Then body text at `#46556a` passed contrast
      on paper and still read washed out across a long answer, so it went
      to `#2c3747`. Then the chat bubbles vanished: the answer card's
      background *was* `--bg`, and the question bubble sat one shade off it.
      They got their own tokens (`--answer-bg`, `--question-bg`,
      `--answer-shadow`), which resolve to the old values on dark and to a
      white, faintly shadowed card and a glass-blue wash on light.
      **`--seed-ref` went teal → gold** — the chips that *build* a graph sat
      a hair from the new glass-blue accent of the chips that spotlight
      one, and gold is already the seed's colour on the canvas, which is
      what those chips make. Smaller sweeps: four near-black modal/tour
      scrims tinted navy, two settings tints hard-coded from the old accent
      now `color-mix` the variable. **Deliberately untouched:** the relation
      palette (`graph/theme.ts`), so references keep `#6ea8fe` and no longer
      share the accent's hue. The wordmark went through two looks (blue and
      gold words; the visor glass on light) before being parked in glass
      blue — its redesign is a Backlog ticket. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,

- [x] **A full-bleed astronaut, oval in both themes — and a theme switch
      that re-lights the landing** *(v8.6.0)* — Patrick repainted the home
      page's astronaut (v8.5.0, below) to fill its whole canvas, which made
      v8.5.0's cut-outs obsolete. **Dark** became the painting as painted with
      an elliptical CSS `mask-image` doing the shadowing — a one-number edit
      instead of a regenerated image. **Light took four tries, recorded so
      nobody repeats them:** the same elliptical fade (a grey haze — dark paint
      at partial alpha over off-white); the new painting inside v8.5.0's
      watercolour brush edge stretched to the new width (right finish, wrong
      shape beside dark's oval); that edge warped straight from a square onto
      an ellipse (pinched diagonals, a lemon with points); and what shipped —
      measure where the old painting's paint ends along each of 1,440
      directions, smooth that over ~15° so the square's overall shape divides
      out while the brush wiggle stays, and map it onto an ellipse at 88% of
      the half-size (92% clipped the strokes flat against the image edge). The
      painting sits on white paper inside it and `multiply` makes the paper
      the page. **The theme switch:** Patrick wanted the picture, greeting and
      bar to rise in together on a ☀/☾ toggle. The per-theme `<img>` swap was
      already replaying the picture's entrance by itself (an element leaving
      `display: none` restarts its CSS animations), so the fix was to replay
      the other two with it: a `useTheme()` effect in `Teacher.tsx` restarts
      all three in place via `getAnimations()` (cancel, play), never by
      remounting, which would drop a half-typed question. Reduced motion has
      nothing to replay, since those animations are `none` there. Files:
      `curious-astronaut-{dark,light}.webp`, 31 KB + 30 KB; v8.5.0's two
      `curious-astronaut-floating-*` images are gone. *(Patrick's ask,
      2026-10-04; browser-tested and approved the same day.)*

- [x] **The floating astronaut on the home page** *(v8.5.0)* — Patrick's
      watercolour of the astronaut drifting through a nebula now sits above
      *"What do you want to explore?"*, rising in with the greeting and the
      bar on their shared entrance. The painting came on white paper, and
      that was the whole problem. **A white-to-transparent cut-out didn't
      work on dark:** the pale lavender fringe survived as a torn-paper
      border, and a few near-white specks with it. What did work was to give
      up on the edge entirely: take the solid paint only (holes like the
      white suit filled back in), erode it well inside the dark paint, feather
      it wide, and multiply by an ellipse — inset further on the right, where
      the painting itself is cropped flat — so the navy dissolves into the
      page. Two follow-ups from the browser: the first ellipse still let the
      fringe show as a haze along the top (shrunk), and the crop cut through a
      nearly-transparent tail, leaving a faint straight line on the left (the
      tail now snaps to zero before cropping). **That fade fails on light** —
      dark paint feathering over off-white leaves a grey halo — so light
      gets a second cut: the original paper, `mix-blend-mode: multiply`, which
      makes the white exactly the page colour and keeps the watercolour edge
      as painted. Two WebPs in `frontend/public/` (53 KB + 30 KB, from a
      564 KB JPG kept out of the repo), swapped by `data-theme`, decorative
      (`alt=""`), capped at `30vh` so a short window keeps the composer on
      screen. *(Patrick's ask, 2026-10-03; browser-tested and approved the
      same night.)*

- [x] **Enlarge the favicon** *(v8.4.0)* — the helmet mark read small in a
      browser tab beside full-bleed icons like Gmail's and GitHub's: the
      64-unit drawing grid left real margin around the mark, and the comm
      boxes stood 4.5 units proud of the shell, so the helmet circle filled
      only ~72% of the icon. Two changes, both in `frontend/public/favicon.svg`
      and nowhere else (it is only ever the tab icon): the `viewBox` is
      cropped to the mark (`7 7 50 50`), and the comm boxes are **tucked in**
      to stand 2 units proud rather than 4.5 — the crop alone only reached
      ~82%, because the boxes set the width. The circle now fills ~92%.
      Tried on the way, rendered side by side on the tab-bar colour: a 1-unit
      tuck (`8 8 48 48`, ~96%) — Patrick tried it and went back to 2; and
      dropping the comm boxes entirely (100%), which turns the helmet into a
      plain round face at 16px. The full mascot's shapes and palette are
      untouched. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-10-02; browser-tested and
      approved by Patrick, 2026-10-03.)*

- [x] **The Library is a modal** *(v7.32.0)* — the rail's 📚 entry now opens
      a centred dialog over the workspace, the same shell as Settings (scrim,
      card radius, shadow — `.library-backdrop` / `.library-modal` mirror
      `settings.css`; narrower, at 680px, since the library is one column,
      and it hugs its content up to 86vh). Its third shape: a right-hand
      drawer to v7.8.0, then a **main-pane view** the rail switched to and
      that hid the workspace behind it — the drawer's 400px had been too
      narrow for a growing list, but a full-pane detour was more page than a
      list-and-upload form needed, and the rail's two management entries,
      Library and Settings, ought to open the same kind of thing. The
      workspace stays mounted and untouched behind it, as it did behind the
      view; what went is the plumbing the view needed — the `ShellView` state,
      the rail's active-entry toggle, `atlas-body`'s `hidden`, the `variant`
      prop with the drawer wrapper the tour had been staging, and the dead
      `.drawer-backdrop`. The modal's scrim sits at z-index 50 so the tour's
      60–62 still spotlights the card on the "Inside the library" step.
- [x] **The data source is a rail row** *(v7.31.0)* — the expanded rail's
      *Data source* was a heading plus a bordered `<select>`, and while the
      Backlog ticket it closes (*"The Data Provider dropdown's text sits
      off-centre"*, filed 2026-08-14 against the header-era
      `.provider-select`) had gone stale with the move to the rail, the
      control was still the one thing on the rail that lined up with nothing:
      its box started at the heading column and its text sat 9px in from
      that, on no column at all, above a band of entries whose glyphs and
      labels share one grid. It is now a **native `<select>` dressed as a
      rail row** — the database cylinder (hoisted into a shared
      `DatabaseGlyph`, so the collapsed icon and the row draw the same mark)
      in the glyph lane, the chosen backend's name on the label column, a
      caret at the row's far end, and the browser's own list on click. The
      row shows the *choice* rather than the words "Data source" because a
      native select can only display its selected option; the tooltip
      carries the heading. Two custom-popup shapes were tried and rejected on
      the way: opening beside the rail (the collapsed rail's behaviour) put
      the list a whole rail-width from its entry, and popping it up from the
      entry read as a second control. One wrinkle: a select keeps focus after
      its list closes and browsers count that as keyboard-visible even off a
      mouse click, so the row stayed ringed after every choice — the change
      handler blurs it, and keyboard focus lights the row like a hover
      instead of boxing the text. Collapsed, the cylinder alone with its
      right-hand popup is unchanged.
- [x] **The search chip names the corpus; the settings nav icons match; "Curious Astronaut"
      lines up** *(v7.30.0)* — three things found looking at the app after
      v7.29.0. The researcher's paper-search chip reads **`🔎 Searching
      Semantic Scholar for “…”`** while the scout runs and **`🔎 Searched
      OpenAlex for “…” · 3 new`** once it has, instead of a bare `Searching
      for` / `Searched`. The name rides the trace event (`SearchTrace.provider`,
      on the pending announcement as well as the finished report, since the
      pending chip is what the reader stares at for the whole run) rather than
      the dropdown at render time, so a turn saved under one provider and
      replayed under the other still says where it actually looked; turns from
      before the field existed render the bare verb they always did. In the
      settings modal, **General's gear was visibly smaller than the other
      four** section icons: `⚙` (U+2699) and `🕸` (U+1F578) are *text-default*
      code points, so the font drew them as small monochrome glyphs beside
      three full-size colour emoji — both now carry U+FE0F, the emoji
      variation selector, and the column is one icon set. And the rail's
      **brand row kept a tighter 6px gap** than the 10px every other entry
      uses ("this row is a wordmark", said the comment), which put "Curious Astronaut" 4px
      left of every label below it; it takes the entry's gap now.
- [x] **Settings: a Library section, per-vendor "Apply Default Models", a
      settings tour, and the dead frontier-window row gone** *(v7.29.0)* — four
      things the settings modal had been missing, found while switching
      vendors after v7.28.1. **Library** (the `sources` config block, editable
      only by hand until now) is a section of four sub-pages — *General* holds
      the `semantic_enabled` master switch, *Embedding* / *Chunking* /
      *Retrieval* mirror the three typed sub-blocks — and applies live: the
      embedder's process-wide singleton is now keyed on the config that loaded
      it, so a saved model/device edit reloads on the next search and the
      switch flipped off and on works without a restart. **Apply Default
      Models** ends each vendor's group on *Model Providers*: one click puts
      the lecturer and researcher on the vendor's *advanced* model and the
      summarizer and both scouts on its *light* one, then moves the modal to
      Agent Settings so the change is visible where it happened; the picks are
      the backend's (`GET /api/settings/models` now carries `tiers`, ranked by
      name on the newest-first listing — Sonnet/Haiku, mainline `gpt-`/`-mini`
      with dated snapshots skipped in favour of the alias, Flash/Flash-Lite
      and never Pro because Pro 429s on the free tier, Ollama by parameter
      count), the tooltip names both before pressing, and the button greys
      out with no credential in the draft. The `live` voice line (`gpt-live-1`,
      `gemini-live-*`) joined the non-chat markers — it had been the "advanced"
      pick purely because letters sort above digits. The **settings tour** is
      the modal's own ringed **?** beside its ✕: the shared `Tour` engine over
      `SETTINGS_TOUR`, mounted inside the modal, whose steps stage
      `<section>/<page>` so the walk drives the nav; auto-runs once on first
      open, then only from the button. Also: the cost badges on the vendor
      headings and OpenAI's compatible-server-URL row are gone as clutter;
      each agent group opens with an italic line saying what the agent *is*,
      with the Model row's hint reduced to "the LLM that drives this agent"
      plus what kind suits; and the lecturer's *Frontier window* row — which
      `LecturerExtras` had dropped in v7.17.0 and, being `extra="forbid"`,
      would have rejected any value typed into it — is deleted. Shapes tried
      and dropped on the way, recorded in `settings/README.md` so nobody
      retries them: an every-agent row of vendor + model selects (bulky, and
      one model for every agent is the wrong idea), a pill on the group
      heading (stray), a labelled "Run every agent here" row with a caption
      line (restated the button), the master switch on the Library landing
      page (read as navigation), and a left rule / translucent card behind the
      agent blurb (too cute). *(2026-09-18.)*
- [x] **Make the provenance line a control, not a caption** *(v7.22.0)* — **superseded
      2026-09-14 by *Threads — one thread, one graph* (Larger phases):**
      under threads a turn's papers are always on its own graph, so the
      line has nothing to re-open and the click below is deleted rather
      than built. Kept until that ships so the reasoning isn't lost. —
      The original ask: the quiet
      summary under an answer ("grounded in 1 of your sources + 1 paper ✦",
      `teacher/transcript/provenance.ts`) reads as a label, but it names the
      one thing a reader most wants to act on. **Ask:** when the paper it
      cites isn't on screen, the line becomes clickable and *seeds the graph*
      on it — tinted like a seeding `[n]` chip and ending in the graph glyph
      instead of the ✦. When the answer's papers **are** already on the graph,
      it stays exactly as it is: current colour, current diamond, because the
      whole-bubble click already re-lights them and a second affordance saying
      the same thing is noise.

      **What to settle first:** which paper it seeds when the answer cites
      more than one. The line is a *count* ("+ 3 papers"), not a reference, so
      there's no single target — options are seeding the first cited paper,
      splitting the count into per-paper chips, or only offering the click in
      the unambiguous one-paper case. The reuse is otherwise clean: the
      chip's colour, glyph and seed handler all exist (`AnswerMarkdown`'s
      `cite-ref-seed` + `GraphGlyph` + `onPaperSeed`), and the
      already-on-the-graph test is the same `onGraphIds` set that greys stale
      chips. Any provider stamp on the seeded id has to come along too — see
      the graph-free provider ticket above. *(Patrick's ask, 2026-08-14.)*

      **Closed as superseded in v7.22.0.** Thread ownership replaces this proposed control.



- [x] **The ask bar holds the question and nothing else** *(v7.11.0)* — the
      composer had accumulated three controls *inside* the pill — the 📚
      source scope, the 🔍 Find-papers toggle and the ▽ Filters button — and
      together they turned the one thing you came to the app to use, a box to
      type in, into a toolbar with a text field wedged in it. Patrick's
      reference was Claude's own composer against ChatGPT's: *"get away from
      putting the scope picker and search filters in the chat bar. It's too
      much clutter."*

      **The pill was emptied; the controls went to whichever row the panel's
      shape already had.** With **no graph** there are no sections to receive
      them, so they became a chip row directly *beneath* the bar
      (`.ask-tools`) — beneath rather than above, so you read the question
      first and then what bounds it, and far enough from the field to stop
      reading as chrome around it. With a **graph** they went *up* onto the
      **Chat** section's caret row, joining the 🎓 and 📚 scopes that landed
      there in v7.10.0 for exactly the same reason: all four bind the
      researcher answering below, not the lecturer above. Each element is
      rendered in one of the two places, never both.

      **Two details the move turned out to depend on.** The bar and its chip
      row are wrapped in `.ask-dock`, which is what the landing surface's FLIP
      now measures — the group drops from the optical centre to the bottom on
      the first question, and a chip row that snapped down while the bar above
      it slid would have read as two unrelated controls. And the filter
      popover, which spans a whole row rather than its button (a year slider
      needs the width), had been anchored to `.teacher-ask`; it now anchors to
      whichever row it lands in and picks its direction from the room —
      upward from the tool row at the bottom of the page, downward from the
      pinned Chat row and from the floating empty-landing composer. The
      `position: relative` that made the bar a containing block is gone, which
      is the mechanical proof nothing is left inside it.

      **The "Answers also draw on N sources (📚)" note became graph-only.** It
      exists because the docked pickers are bare icons with no room for a
      label; in the landing tool row the chip says "2 sources" itself, a
      centimetre below, so the note was the same sentence twice.

- [x] **Drag the rail shut, and drag it back open** *(v7.11.0)* — the left
      rail's resize handle now does two jobs. Keep pulling it past the 180px
      floor and the rail **folds away** instead of sitting there refusing to
      narrow — the Azure DevOps gesture, and what the drag already means:
      someone dragging a panel as narrow as it goes is asking for the space,
      not for 180px of it. The folded rail **keeps its handle**, so the same
      pull the other way brings it back; a collapsed edge you couldn't grab
      would have made the new gesture a one-way door.

      **It's an opt-in on the shared hook, not rail-specific code.**
      `useResizablePanel` gained a `fold` option (`{collapsed,
      collapsedWidth, closeAt, openAt, onToggle}`) that the two right-docked
      panels simply don't pass. Three things it has to get right: both
      thresholds are measured on the **unclamped** drag, so bottoming out
      isn't enough — `closeAt: 130` sits 50px below the floor and `openAt: 96`
      40px past the folded rail's own 56, and the overshoot has to be
      deliberate. A folded panel measures from the width it **shows**, not the
      width it remembers, or the first unfolding drag would start 200px ahead
      of the pointer. And the width you had is saved on the way out, so
      reopening is not a fresh start.

      **The brand row became one hit target while we were in there.** "Curious Astronaut"
      and the seed title are labels rather than controls, and a hover
      highlight that stopped at the glyph made the row look like an icon
      button with two words parked beside it. It is now a `.rail-item` like
      every entry below it — same glyph line, full-width highlight — with the
      seed keeping its own tooltip inside the row's, since it is the one thing
      there that truncates. The tour's rail step teaches both gestures.

- [x] **A chat citation opens the map, not the paper's panel** *(v7.11.0)* —
      **supersedes the deliberate exception carved out in v7.9.0**, below.
      That release stopped every graph from opening with its detail panel
      already covering the canvas, but kept one path: clicking a paper the
      agent cited in a graph-free answer still landed with the seed's panel
      open, on the theory that such a click *asked for that paper*. It asks
      for both — and the panel arrived on top of the half that has to be seen
      first, so the exception reproduced the exact bug it was excepted from.
      Clicking the seed opens it now, like any other node.

      **The whole mechanism came out, not just its effect.**
      `workspace.revealSeedDetail`, the `seedDetailRevealed` reducer that
      spent it, `loadGraph`'s `fromChat` argument and `GraphExplorer`'s
      consuming effect are all deleted — `fromChat` had already lost its other
      job when v7.10.0 made every graph load keep the conversation, so nothing
      was left for it to mean. The comment in `useSelection` that explained
      the effect-ordering trick (the reveal registered *after* the per-graph
      clear so it could set the seed back) now records why there is no
      ordering left to preserve. The README and the tour's "Every answer is a
      way in" step both stopped promising the details.

- [x] **The docked chat scrolled sideways** *(v7.10.0)* — *"beside a graph, the
      assistant panel scrolls **horizontally**, and it should never — content
      belongs inside the panel's width, wrapping or shrinking to fit, and the
      chat box should give width back as the window narrows."* *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-16.)*

      **The ticket's own hypothesis was wrong, and so were the first two
      fixes.** It guessed a viewport-blind width, and the panel's ask-bar
      crowding. The real cause was in the *prose*: an answer wrote "raised
      **$**3.77 billion … up from **$**1.8 billion", and remark-math paired
      those two currency dollars and rendered everything between them —
      sentence, URL, punctuation — as one inline formula. KaTeX output cannot
      wrap, so the 521px result pushed the transcript sideways. It also
      explained the *other* symptom nobody had connected to it: the same
      paragraph reading as italic, letter-spaced nonsense. Patrick's DevTools
      dump settled it — every overhanging element was inside one `SPAN.katex`.
      Full story in [bugs.md](bugs.md).

      **Three fixes shipped, and only the first was the bug.**
      `notation/prepareMath.ts` makes `splitMath`'s verdict binding on
      remark-math; the width clamp did become viewport-aware anyway
      (`min(680px, 40% of the window)`, re-read on resize, with the reader's
      chosen width stored *unclamped* so a widened window hands it back); and
      the transcript got the containment it should always have had —
      `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, a scroller for `.katex-display`, a
      `max-width` backstop on its children, `.md img` capped, and
      `.source-ref` un-`nowrap`ped (it holds a full book or paper title, and
      `nowrap` defeats `overflow-wrap` outright). Deliberately **not**
      `overflow-x: hidden`, which would have hidden the symptom and clipped
      the wide content the other rules give a scroller of its own.

- [x] **A graph opens onto the graph, not onto its panels** *(v7.9.0)* —
      building a graph used to land with two boxes already covering the
      canvas: the **detail panel** (`useSelection`'s per-graph effect selected
      the seed, so the panel was open before the reader had looked at
      anything) and the **graph controls** (272px of declutter chrome,
      expanded by default). Both now start out of the way — the detail panel
      opens on a click, the controls on their header caret — at the moment
      the reader most wants to see the map. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-08-16.)*

      **The assistant is the deliberate exception** and stays docked on graph
      load: the conversation is the product, and Patrick's ask named it
      explicitly. So this is not "hide the chrome", it's "hide the chrome
      that has nothing to say yet" — the two panels that opened themselves
      were both showing defaults (the seed you already know about; filters
      you haven't asked for).

      **Three paths had to keep working, and each is why the change is small
      rather than a redesign.** The **chat-citation** re-seed still opens the
      seed's panel — `workspace.revealSeedDetail` (set by a `fromChat` load,
      consumed in `GraphExplorer`) is an effect registered *after*
      `useSelection`'s per-graph clear, so on the same graph change the clear
      runs first and the reveal puts the seed back; that click *asked* for a
      paper, so it gets its panel. The **guided tour**'s `'details'` stops
      already selected the seed when nothing was open, and its `'controls'`
      stops already expanded a collapsed panel (`stagedOpen`) — staging built
      for a reader who had folded things away, which is now the default
      state. And the controls' collapse is an **initial value only**:
      re-seeding while the explorer is up leaves the panel however the reader
      left it, because expanding it was a choice.

      **The help surfaces moved with it** (the rule from v6.9.0): the tour's
      first controls stop taught "click to collapse" and now says the panel
      starts folded, and the header tooltip reads "Open the graph controls"
      rather than "Reopen". A testing note worth keeping: the panel's body
      hides via `hidden`, which takes it out of the accessibility tree, so
      every GraphControls case about a control *inside* the body now renders
      through a `renderPanel` helper that opens it first.

- [x] **The header becomes a collapsible left rail** *(v7.8.0)* — the top bar
      is gone. A left rail in the ChatGPT/Claude mould replaces it: collapse
      toggle, brand and the open graph's seed title, ✎ New graph, the **saved
      graphs** listed like a chat history, then data source, ＋ Save, 📚
      Library, ⚙ Settings, theme and the tour. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-08-15; shape settled from Patrick's reference screenshots.)*

      **Why the shape.** A top bar spends the scarcest axis — vertical — on
      chrome that is mostly idle, and can't be put away; a rail spends the
      plentiful one and folds to 56px when the map wants the room. It also let
      saved graphs stop hiding behind a drawer button, which is the change
      that made the rail worth building: a thing you accumulate should be
      visible. The **Sessions drawer retired** into that band, and `header/`
      and `sessions/` were deleted outright.

      **Rename needed a backend.** `PATCH /api/sessions/<id>` is new, because
      `save_session` overwrites the whole blob — so changing a name used to
      mean holding the entire workspace, which is possible for the session you
      have open and impossible for the other twelve in a list. It moves the
      name in both places (the column and the copy inside the stored blob), or
      the next save would put the old one back, and deliberately leaves
      `updated_at` alone: the list sorts by it, and a rename that reshuffled
      would lose you the row you just labelled. Saving stopped prompting for a
      name at the same time — it names the graph after its seed and you rename
      in place, since the moment you want to save is the moment you least want
      a dialog.

      **Collapsed is actions only.** The saved list and the labelled
      data-source select are expanded-only: a column of identical 🗂 glyphs
      distinguishes nothing, and a bare cylinder can't show *which* source is
      selected. Collapsed, the data source becomes an icon with a one-click
      popup — deliberately unlike the chat bar's source picker, which is a
      multi-select and has to stay open while you tick things.

      **Three placement lessons, each found by testing.** The seed title took
      three homes: top-left of the pane (sat on the graph controls), centred
      over the canvas (still collided at some panel widths), and finally
      beside the brand in the rail, where it truncates instead of colliding.
      The data-source picker moved off the canvas for the same reason — and
      gained something in the move, since in the rail it is reachable with
      **no graph open**, which matters because it decides which backend the
      assistant's paper searches hit (v6.14.0) and the canvas version was
      gated on a graph existing. And the 🎓 that reopens a collapsed assistant
      had to move from the pane to the **canvas overlays**: the detail panel is
      a sibling of `.canvas-wrap`, so a pane-anchored button sat on top of that
      panel's own ✕ and trapped the reader inside it.

      **The rail resizes** like the two right-docked panels;
      `useResizablePanel` gained a `side` option rather than a twin, since a
      left-docked panel is the exact mirror and only the sign of the drag
      differs. **The library became a main-pane view** (`Sources` grew
      `variant="pane"`), with the workspace **mounted but hidden** behind it —
      a detour, not a teardown, the same reasoning that keeps `Teacher` at one
      position in the tree.

      **Saving now says so.** The ＋ cross-fades to a green ✓ and a toast names
      the graph it saved to. Both use *transitions* rather than keyframes so
      the exit is the entrance reversed for free, and both stay mounted through
      an explicit `leaving` phase — unmounting on the way out is what made the
      first version vanish in a single frame. The faces stack with
      `grid-area: 1 / 1`, not absolute positioning, which takes no part in
      layout and collapsed both boxes to nothing.

- [x] **The landing tour leads with the chat bar** *(v7.6.0)* — `HOME_TOUR`
      opened with "Start with a paper" on the header search, then search
      options, then the data source, then the library, and only reached the
      chat bar at step 6 ("Start here"). That order was right when home *was*
      the search box; since v6.13.0 the chat bar has been the front door, so
      the tour spent five steps on secondary controls before naming the thing
      the page is built around — and the step that finally did was titled as
      if it were the beginning. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-08-14.)*

      Resolved by the ticket it was waiting on. Folding search into the chat
      bar didn't reorder the first steps, it **deleted** them: the search box
      and its Options popover no longer exist, so their two steps went, and
      the ask box leads with two new ones behind it (the direct-search toggle,
      the binding filters). The connective tissue was rewritten rather than
      permuted, as the ticket warned it would have to be — the copy is read in
      sequence, and "This is the front door" only works where it now sits.
      Also swept: the graph tour's find-bar step still said "to pull new
      papers in, use the search box up top."

- [x] **The chat surface got real motion** *(v6.15.0)* — the landing chat was
      visually finished but *arrived* all at once: greeting, composer and every
      answer simply appeared. Now everything that arrives shares one gesture —
      fade up from 16px below, with the fade deliberately lagging the rise so a
      thing surfaces out of the background instead of sliding in
      already-formed. The front door cascades (greeting, then the composer and
      its context note a beat later, moving as one because the note belongs to
      the bar); each chat turn rises in; and each agent trace chip does too,
      which is the one place the motion does real work rather than polish — the
      chips *are* the progress report, and one rising into place reads as
      "something just happened" where a chip silently joining a stack does not.

      **The composer's drop is a FLIP**, because it can't be anything else:
      going from optically centred with the greeting to pinned at the bottom is
      a flex-layout change, and CSS cannot transition those. The bar's position
      is recorded whenever the empty/non-empty state settles, and once the
      browser has placed it anew it's animated from where it *was*. Nothing
      about the layout is faked; only a transform plays over the top.

      **The turn entrance is plain CSS and not state-driven**, which is the
      design rather than the shortcut. A CSS animation fires when an element is
      *created* — exactly once per turn — so the two hazards become structurally
      impossible instead of merely avoided: a streaming answer re-renders on
      every token without restarting anything, and a graph load leaves the
      transcript untouched because the conversation survives a re-seed *without
      remounting*. `HopDots` was extracted at its third caller so the waiting
      bubble, the generating lecture button and the send control share one
      rhythm; `prefers-reduced-motion` drops the CSS entrances and short-circuits
      the FLIP.

      **Two things only testing found.** The lagged fade was first written as a
      mid-keyframe (`55% { opacity: 0.25 }`) — but a timing function applies
      between each *pair* of keyframes, so the fade decelerated into that stop
      and accelerated out of it, a hitch that reads as dropped frames. Splitting
      it into two animations (`rise` eased out, `fade` eased in) gives the same
      look with each curve a single smooth interval. And the transcript turned
      out never to have auto-scrolled at all: the animation merely made it
      visible, since you now watch each chip arrive and then leave. It follows
      its own bottom now, conditionally — scroll up mid-answer and it stops
      chasing, because being yanked back down is worse than the problem it
      solves. The bottom test carries a 40px tolerance precisely *because* of
      the entrance: the last element sits 16px low for the length of its rise,
      and a tight test would disable the follow exactly when a turn arrives.

- [x] **The landing page is a chat bar** *(v6.13.0)* — home was a sentence and
      a button in a lot of empty space, with the assistant filed behind a
      header toggle and gated on owning a library. Now Curious Astronaut opens on a centred
      chat: the assistant is the front door, and needs neither a graph nor an
      uploaded library. Patrick's design, sanity-checked with a co-worker.

      **One instance, two shapes — the decision everything else hangs off.**
      The shell keeps `Teacher` at a single position in the tree and swaps a
      `landing` flag, so entering graph mode collapses the chat into the side
      panel as a *CSS change*. Rendering a separate landing component would
      have remounted the panel and undone v6.11.0's whole point: the answer you
      were reading survives, scroll position and all. The header's Assistant
      tab now appears only in graph mode — it exists to summon something you
      can't see, and on the landing page the chat is already in front of you.
      Ungating deleted `libraryCount` outright; no agent change was needed,
      since the researcher already treats any question as `answered` and
      `search_sources` is `prepare`-gated off when there's no library.

      **Then eight rounds of visual feedback**, which is where most of the work
      went. The ask bar became a single **pill** — the form *is* the control,
      textarea and buttons borderless inside it, focus ringing the whole thing
      — and the docked panel adopted it too, so the chat doesn't change
      character just because a graph appeared. The source scope and Clear both
      moved **into** the bar: on the landing surface the panel head has no
      title and no ✕, so anything left there floated in empty space, and the
      scope was never header furniture anyway — it qualifies the question
      you're about to ask. The scope trigger is now its icon alone (the popover
      shows the truth once open, an accent fill marks a narrowed scope, the
      tooltip spells it out), and its popover opens upward. Clear takes the
      send button's round shape but stays muted — it's the destructive one and
      mustn't compete with the control you came to press. The send doubles as
      **stop**: hopping dots at rest, a stop square on hover, never disabled
      mid-flight, keeping the partial answer.

      **Three bugs found in that feedback loop, each a real defect.** A stale
      first draft of the landing CSS survived a rewrite underneath the new one,
      so `flex: 0 1 auto; margin-top: auto` applied to *every* landing state
      and the bar drifted down the page as each SSE event arrived — the stranded
      block also carried an unscoped `.teacher-head` rule that stripped the
      docked panel's header border. Moving the scope picker inside the `<form>`
      made `.teacher-ask button` match the popover's own All/None/✕ and blow
      them up into giant accent circles (`> button` is the fix, and the comment
      now says what it's protecting). And the error card's ✕ rendered but
      couldn't be clicked: `.overlay` is `pointer-events: none` *by design* so
      a "Building graph…" card doesn't block what's underneath, so the button
      had to opt back in.

      **Light mode got its own pass.** The composer was borrowing `--chip`,
      which on light sits ~1% off `--bg` — it read as nothing at all. It has
      its own theme variables now: dark lifts off the page with fill, light is
      a raised white card with a border and hairline shadow. The panel's
      trace-row and active-answer tints were alpha washes of a pale periwinkle
      tuned against dark; on light they vanished, so the alphas are variables
      and light gets a deeper hue and more of it. Worth remembering from that:
      `--lecture` is declared **on `.teacher`**, so a `:root[data-theme=...]`
      override cannot reach it — custom properties resolve from the nearest
      declaring ancestor, not by specificity.
      *(From the 2026-08-10 design conversation; shipped 2026-08-14.)*

- [x] **Wrap text in the research chat input** *(v6.5.0)* — the ask box was a
      single-line `<input>`, so longer questions scrolled sideways and were hard
      to read while composing. It's now an **auto-growing `<textarea>`** that
      wraps and grows with the content up to a ~140px cap (then scrolls),
      snapping back to one line after a send. **Enter sends; ⇧ Shift+Enter drops
      a newline** (the standard chat gesture), and the Ask button stays pinned to
      the bottom line. A JS `scrollHeight` measure drives the height over a
      `min-height` one-line floor — the floor also saves the first mount inside
      the *collapsed* (`display:none`) panel, where a hidden element measures
      `scrollHeight: 0` and would otherwise pin the box to a clipped zero height
      until the next keystroke. The tour's ask step gained an "Enter to send;
      Shift+Enter for a new line" line so the in-app help tracks the new gesture.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-19.)*
- [x] **Larger tour jump caret** *(v6.5.0)* — the ▾ on a tour bubble's title
      (its jump-to-any-stop affordance, `tour/tour.css`) was easy to miss at
      11px; bumped to 15px so it reads as the interactive dropdown it is.
      *(2026-07-24.)*
- [x] **Settings modal stage 2 — the adaptive sizing switch & per-chip count
      sliders** *(v6.3.0)* — the graph-*shaping* half of the settings-modal
      ticket (the modal itself shipped in v6.1.0). A new **Graph** section
      carries a single **"Size graphs automatically"** switch. ON (the default,
      and every build before this) the app sizes itself — the STOP/SKIP rules
      pick the landmark band, the fitted tau rule places the Latest cluster
      start. OFF, the build ships **everything it can** (the
      `UNBOUNDED_LANDMARK_CAP` payload guard as the only ceiling) and hands the
      Latest band shape to the user: cluster start, number of bands, papers per
      band (code defaults in `integrations/caps.py`, overridden per request).
      **The shape is the user's, not the deployment's** — it rides on each graph
      request from a localStorage module store (`graph/buildShape.ts`, the
      `ui/theme.ts` pattern), deliberately *not* back in `config.json` (the
      v6.0.0 purge deleted the old file toggles for exactly this reason). It's
      not a Redux slice either: `workspace.provider` is the closest analogue, but
      that's part of a *saved session*, and reopening a saved graph should
      rebuild it the way *you* currently size graphs, not the way whoever saved
      it did.
      **Non-adaptive mode added no branches to the traversals.** All three
      citation paths (live S2, the S2 corpus, OpenAlex) already take their sizing
      rules as injected callables and already fall back to the flat payload guard
      when a rule declines — so "ship everything" is just a `BuildShape` injecting
      a budget rule that always returns None and dropping the truncated-pool SKIP
      selector. A new `services/graph/shape.py` holds that decision; no provider
      learns shapes exist. Along the way the band constants were made to **resolve
      at call time, not in a signature default** — a literal default would freeze
      `caps.py`'s import-time values, so `number_of_bands`/`nodes_per_band`
      default to None and read the shared constants inside the traversal (which
      also fixed the traversal tests that monkeypatch those constants).
      **The cache key.** Snapshots are keyed `(provider, seed)`, which knows
      nothing about shape — so `BuildShape.cache_suffix()` joins it, but is
      **empty for an adaptive build**, so the default path's key is byte-for-byte
      the pre-shape one and every already-cached snapshot still hits; each
      distinct non-adaptive shape caches beside the adaptive one instead of
      clobbering it.
      **The count sliders come back** (a feature we once had and removed): with
      sizing off, each relation's filter chip becomes the label atop its own
      count slider — styled to match the year/citation range sliders (same 4px
      track, 16px thumb, colored fill) after two of Patrick's design rounds
      (checkbox → pill switch; a separate slider block → the chip-as-label
      layout). Drag to keep the N most-cited of that relation — a **display
      trim**, so widening back costs no rebuild. The chip stays the on/off
      toggle (highlighted while on); turning it off hides its slider. Ranking is
      over the base graph, not the filtered view, so the year slider doesn't
      renumber what "top 20" means.
      The **adaptive switch rebuilds the graph immediately** (one click is a
      complete intent); the band-shape numbers rebuild on modal close (they
      write per keystroke — rebuilding each would hammer the provider), both
      watched in `App.tsx` off the store so the modal stays a settings editor
      that knows nothing about the graph. Open question parked: with adaptive ON,
      whether nodes-per-band should come from the SKIP rule instead of the fixed
      50. The **corpus on/off toggle** — the ticket's other half — stays in the
      Backlog. Two settings-modal tidy-ups rode along: the Latest-bands fields
      now **grey but still show their values** while automatic sizing is on (a
      disabled-input style — the browser default read as still-editable), and the
      lone **Citations Corpus** section folded into **Data Providers ▸ Semantic
      Scholar**, where the `storage.s2_corpus` path belongs. *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-16; scoped 2026-07-19; switch/slider design
      rounds by Patrick, 2026-07-20; browser-tested.)*

- [x] **A light/dark mode toggle** *(v6.2.0)* — the app was dark-only. A
      header toggle (beside settings) now switches themes, remembered per
      browser, with a new `ui.default_theme` config setting deciding what a
      browser with no saved choice opens in — the same shape as
      `providers.default_provider`, and editable in the settings modal's
      General section. **The icon shows the action, not the state** (☀ while
      dark, ☾ while light): a single toggle labelled with its current state
      is the one people click twice.
      The palette was mostly ready — dark lives on `:root`, light on
      `:root[data-theme='light']` — but the ticket's warning about *what
      doesn't read the tokens* was the real work. **The canvas paints with
      JS**, so it can't inherit a stylesheet: node labels and rings were
      hardcoded near-white and the backdrop a literal `#0f1115`, i.e.
      white-on-white text on a black rectangle in light mode. Three
      `--canvas-*` inks plus the background now come through a
      `useCanvasInk()` hook that re-reads on theme change (the painters are
      inline props, so they close over fresh values next frame). Two floating
      popovers and the controls panel + legend hardcoded a translucent *dark*
      surface — now `--panel-float`/`--panel-float-soft`; black shadows and
      white hover washes became `--shadow`/`--hover` across seven
      stylesheets. **The relation palette is deliberately not themed**: gold
      seed, blue references, green landmarks, and pink search carry meaning
      and read on either background, so only the neutrals flip.
      Two rounds of Patrick's browser feedback shaped the result. The first
      light palette read as harsh, correctly: near-black ink (#11141b) on
      off-white is ~17:1, more than double what even WCAG's strictest tier
      asks, and borders dark enough to outline every panel. Softened toward
      the React/Angular docs' greys (strong text #23272f, barely-there
      borders, a desaturated accent). And the header buttons were three
      different sizes because their geometry was *derived* — height fell out
      of padding plus whatever line box the content produced, so a 17px
      glyph, a bold "?", and a text label each sized their own button;
      `.sources-toggle` now declares a 34px height with flex centring and
      `.icon-toggle` a 34px width, taking content out of the geometry
      entirely. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-19; browser-tested.)*

- [x] **A settings modal — the app's config, editable in place** *(v6.1.0)* —
      there was nowhere in the UI to configure anything: every setting was a
      `config.json` hand-edit plus a server restart. The modal (⚙, top-right
      beside the help button) is a **config-file editor**, laid out like
      Claude Desktop's settings — a left sidebar with a search field and
      grouped nav, a right pane of label-left / control-right rows on
      hairline dividers, skinned with the app's own dark tokens.
      **The file stays the single source of truth:** the modal loads the
      active `config.json`, edits a local draft, and writes the whole object
      back on Save; the server validates *before* writing anything and folds
      accepted values into the running app in place (`config.reload_config`),
      so changes apply **without a restart** — the load-once-at-import
      question the ticket flagged, answered by mutating the shared object
      rather than by a per-request override. A rejected save writes nothing
      and comes back as a **per-field** error list (`{path, message}`),
      rendered one readable line per bad setting instead of raw Pydantic
      text. Sections: General (default data source, graph cache lifetime,
      and the **config-file location** — an editable path plus a 📁 button
      that opens the *native* OS chooser via the backend, because a browser
      never reveals absolute paths; the choice persists in a gitignored
      `.config-location` sidecar), Data Providers (keys, throttles), Agents
      (all five, each with a **model dropdown** populated live from the
      Anthropic Models API, plus the lecturer/researcher/librarian knobs),
      and Citations Corpus. Search is **PyCharm-style** — rows are a
      registry, so typing filters the nav to sections with a matching row
      *and* the pane to the matching rows themselves.
      **Three things this forced open along the way.** (1) `llm.agents[].extras`
      stopped being a free-form `dict[str, Any]` that each agent package
      range-checked by hand at import — it's typed now, per-agent models in
      `config.AGENT_EXTRAS` (`LecturerExtras`/`ResearcherExtras`/
      `LibrarianExtras`) with bounded types, defaults, descriptions, and a
      min≤max beats rule; a nonsensical knob (`min_beats: -1`) is refused at
      save where it used to sail through, and the three agent packages lost
      their defaults dicts and hand-rolled checks entirely. (2) Flask's
      `jsonify` alphabetizes keys, so every modal round-trip was silently
      re-sorting `config.json` — `sort_keys` is off and each save is written
      in the example template's canonical key order, making saves stable and
      diffs readable. (3) `providers.default_provider` turned out to be
      **inert**: the store hardcoded `'s2'` and the frontend names a provider
      on every request, so neither the dropdown's initial state nor the
      backend fallback ever consulted it — the app now seeds the header
      selector from it on mount (only when nothing is loaded, so a restored
      session isn't yanked). Number fields also carry their config field's
      floor client-side (spinner stop + clamp), as a second line behind the
      server's validation. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-16; layout,
      scope, and polish rounds by Patrick, 2026-07-19; browser-tested.
      Stage 2 — the adaptive sizing switch, the revived per-chip sliders, and
      the band-shape inputs — shipped in v6.3.0 (above); the corpus on/off
      toggle stays in the Backlog.)*

- [x] **Show the publisher/venue in the Detail panel** *(v5.26.0)* — the
      panel named no venue. Now the meta block reads **`Authors: …`** /
      **`Publisher: *venue*`** (prefix plain, value italicized — both
      Patrick's browser-round calls) above the unchanged date · citations
      line. Full-stack: both providers gained a **`venue`** on the shared
      node shape — S2 prefers the normalized `publicationVenue` record with
      the legacy `venue` string as fallback (`venue_name()`), OpenAlex takes
      `primary_location.source.display_name` — as a **detail-tier** field
      like the abstract (seed at build via DETAIL_FIELDS/DETAIL_SELECT,
      neighbors hydrate on first open; arXiv-only papers honestly read
      "arXiv"). The graph model defaults it None so pre-venue cached
      snapshots validate, and `cleanNode` persists it (a restored node with
      an abstract never re-hydrates — dropping it would lose the seed's
      venue every restore; note the same gap exists for `fields_of_study`,
      which cleanNode has never persisted). The polish rounds also aired
      out the panel: meta rows 3→10px apart, tag groups 10→16px. Tests: S2
      preference/fallback/empty, OpenAlex primary-location/missing/
      sourceless, a DetailPanel render case; field-tier READMEs updated.

- [x] **Select-all for find-bar matches** *(v5.25.0)* — the lexical find
      spotlighted matches, but scoping the teacher to them meant
      alt-dragging or shift-clicking one by one. The find pill now commits
      the whole match set to the hand-picked selection in one press — a
      **"select" link** beside the hit count AND **Enter in the box**
      (added on Patrick's browser round; both affordances kept on purpose:
      the link is discoverable, Enter is fast; Enter no-ops on zero hits).
      Additive via `nodeSelectionAdded`, exactly like the marquee, so
      repeated finds build a scope; GraphExplorer clears the find on
      commit so the cyan selection (not the find spotlight) shows the
      result — find → select → ask in three gestures. Tour's find stop,
      input/link tooltips, and the controls README teach both paths
      (final tour phrasing Patrick's own); FindBar suite +2 cases on a new
      makeProps helper. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-18; shipped
      2026-07-18.)*
- [x] **DATA SOURCE dropdown arrow overflows its box** *(v5.24.1)* — the
      header select relied on the native caret, which macOS rendered just
      past the rounded border. Fixed by owning the caret:
      `appearance: none` plus a muted data-URI SVG chevron drawn inside the
      box (`--muted` hardcoded — CSS vars can't reach into a `url()`), with
      right padding reserving its lane. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-18; shipped 2026-07-18.)*
- [x] **Cleaner layout for expanded nodes — in BOTH layouts** *(v5.24.0)* —
      the researcher's `expand_node` discoveries used to land on top of the
      seed's neighborhood; after v5.23.0's relation clustering the failure
      got legible (a dashed-ring `reference` discovery was absorbed into the
      seed's blue sector, torn away from the node it was expanded from).
      Shipped as the sketched **satellite mini-clusters**: `useDiscovery`'s
      merge stamps a discovery anchored on a non-seed node with `_origin`,
      and the cluster force gathers such satellites just **beyond their
      origin, on the seed→origin ray** (own √population offset, pull 0.12 —
      a touch over the sectors' 0.08 so small groups stay gathered), the
      formation following the origin's live position. Satellite links stay
      short (the per-type orbit distance would have dragged them a whole
      orbit out — the accessor checks resolved endpoints for `_origin`),
      and satellites don't inflate sector populations. **Timeline**: x is
      date-pinned, so the merge bands satellites **outward in y** past
      their origin's side of the settled (height-frozen) mass instead.
      **Restore round**: a browser-verified session-reopen initially
      dissolved the satellites — saves fold discoveries into the graph, so
      the stamps were lost; `clusterForce.deriveOrigins` re-derives them in
      GraphExplorer's base build (first edge's other endpoint, when not the
      seed). Found while chasing a reported restore→Timeline "blank screen"
      via Claude-in-Chrome live debugging — canvas-arc hooks showed all 374
      nodes at finite coords and a mathematically correct zoomToFit, and
      the blank turned out to be a stale cached bundle (gone on hard
      reload), not a code defect. Vitest 147 → 154 (sector-vs-origin
      priority, orphaned-origin fallback, sector-count exemption, origin
      stamping/derivation, the Timeline y-band). *(From the `todos.md`
      inbox, 2026-07-14; shipped 2026-07-18.)*
- [x] **Group graph nodes by relation type in the Force layout** *(v5.23.0)*
      — the force layout mingled every relation into one undifferentiated
      cloud ("way waayyy too much clutter" — Patrick, triggering the
      immediate build). Now a custom d3 force (`graph/clusterForce.ts`)
      organizes the neighborhood into **relation clusters around the seed**:
      fixed compass sectors, stable across graphs — references **west**
      (past-is-left, echoing Timeline), Field Landmarks up-right, Latest
      Publications down-right, the researcher's similar/search discoveries
      on the west diagonals — with anchors computed from the seed's LIVE
      position each tick (drag the seed, the formation follows) and each
      cluster's orbit growing with **√population** (area scales with the
      papers), so big clusters sit farther from the seed and each other.
      In-cluster spacing from a radius-sized collide (Force mode previously
      allowed overlap). The real clutter culprit: the **default link force**
      (distance 30, full strength on leaf nodes) yanked every neighbor into
      one clump on the seed — links now stretch to their relation cluster's
      orbit at low strength (0.08), defaults captured once and restored on
      the switch to Timeline. `useTimeline` became the explicit single
      owner of the d3 force slots (both layouts write 'collide'/'link'/
      'cluster' — two owners would fight on every switch), with one shared
      new-graph effect re-applying whichever layout is active; discoveries
      re-balance orbits for free via the force's own `initialize`. Vitest
      +7 (sector directions, √ orbits, live-seed anchoring, seed exemption,
      discovery re-init). Browser round: approved as-shipped; it also made
      the expansion-clutter failure legible — sharpening the separate
      "Cleaner layout for expanded nodes" ticket (satellite mini-clusters
      around the expansion origin, Timeline y-band treatment). *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-10; shipped 2026-07-18.)*
- [x] **Reorder the tour steps to match expectation** *(v5.22.0)* — some
      GRAPH_TOUR stops ran in an order that didn't match how the eye moves
      through the UI; re-sequenced live with Patrick over three browser
      rounds (an AskUserQuestion picked the shape, then two corrections
      from walking it). The walk now: the top-left **controls panel walked
      top-to-bottom through its last row** ("Open a paper" — it lives in
      the panel, which round two caught after find was first slotted
      before it), then the **bottom-right find control** (it used to OPEN
      the tour — a leftover from its top-right era; starting on a tiny
      corner button read as a diagonal jump), then a **new whole-panel
      "The paper detail panel" overview stop** (round three's ask;
      spotlights the entire `data-tour="details"` aside, staging
      `'details'` like its section stops) before the five per-section
      detail stops, then the teacher block reordered to **lecture-scope →
      source-scope → lectures → ask** (both scope pickers before the
      lecture grid). HOME_TOUR reviewed and left as-is (header
      left-to-right already). Pure `steps.ts` array surgery + one new
      step; no component changes. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-18;
      shipped 2026-07-18.)*
- [x] **A loading state over the whole Detail panel while its pieces arrive**
      *(v5.21.0)* — the panel fans out to several services after opening
      (S2/OpenAlex abstract hydration, arXiv category tags, HF code links,
      the ar5iv figure strip), and each piece popped in as its call landed,
      so the panel assembled jankily. Shipped in two design rounds. Round
      one built the ticket's sketched "honest middle": per-section
      **skeleton placeholders** — anonymous shimmer shapes (`Skeleton`
      in-file, `.skel-*` variants; `aria-hidden`, shimmer off under
      `prefers-reduced-motion`), headless on purpose since a section may
      resolve to "nothing" and a named header that then vanishes is its own
      jank — each resolving independently. The browser round exposed the
      flaw: figures sometimes beat the abstract, so the assembly still read
      staggered. Round two (Patrick's call) put everything behind **one
      joint gate**: while ANY fetch is in flight, every loadable section
      holds its skeleton — even one whose answer already landed — and the
      whole set reveals in a single paint when the last answer arrives;
      empty sections simply don't appear. Node-local parts (badges, title,
      meta, actions) render instantly. Plumbing: `useSelection` grew a
      `detailLoading` id for the summary hydration; the arXiv-keyed trio
      infers "in flight" from `arxiv_id && response === undefined` (those
      fetches always fire on first open and cache failures), which let the
      old `figuresLoading` prop and the hook's exposed `figLoading` retire.
      The "Loading figures…" text hint retired too. Vitest: new
      `DetailPanel.test.tsx` (5 cases: the gate holding a known abstract,
      the one-paint reveal, instant node-local parts, the non-arXiv paths).
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-18; shipped 2026-07-18.)*
- [x] **Mirror the collapsed bar's readout in the expanded panel — and fold
      "clear" into the action row** *(v5.20.0)* — the v5.19.0 collapsed bar
      got the honest readout but the expanded footer still read the bare
      `78 / 356 papers`, and the selection status kept its own
      `2 picked · clear` row. Now **one readout string, computed once,
      renders in both places**: `N / total papers shown` under bare filters,
      flipping to `N / shown papers selected` during a hand-pick (same
      shown-papers denominator, honest to the `selected ∩ visible` teacher
      scope). The status row retired, and **clear became a proper Clear
      button** in the action row after Release / Fit / Refresh — always
      present, disabled until a pick or a teacher highlight exists
      (Refresh's disabled pattern), firing the same shared reset as Esc.
      The footer now stacks (readout line above the four-button row):
      side-by-side already wrapped awkwardly with three buttons in
      Patrick's screenshot, and the longer wording + fourth button settled
      it. Tour's actions stop grew into "Release · Fit · Refresh · Clear"
      with a sentence for the new button; controls README reworked; tests
      rewritten around the button's disabled/armed states and both readout
      flips. *(From Patrick's screenshot review, 2026-07-18; shipped
      2026-07-18.)*
- [x] **Collapse the graph controls panel to a single bar** *(v5.19.0)* —
      the declutter panel (`GraphControls.tsx`, pinned top-left) was a fixed
      272px box over the canvas whether or not the user was touching it. The
      panel now wears a **"Graph controls" header strip that is itself a
      button**: one click collapses the whole panel to that slim bar (the
      width shrinks with it — the FindBar's collapse-until-wanted idea,
      panel-sized), another reopens it. The collapsed bar keeps reporting
      state — `N / total PAPERS SHOWN` under bare filters, flipping to
      `N / shown PAPERS SELECTED` while a hand-pick exists (denominator = the
      *shown* papers, honest to the `selected ∩ visible` teacher scope) —
      wording and both fractions tuned across the browser rounds. Collapse
      hides the body via `hidden` rather than unmounting, so the tour's
      `presentIf` existence checks still see the year/citation stops; a new
      tour stop on the header teaches the gesture, and every stop inside the
      panel now stages **`'controls'`** (`Curious Astronaut` → `GraphExplorer`'s
      `tourStage` → the new `stagedOpen` prop), re-expanding a collapsed
      panel mid-walk and never re-collapsing after (the detail panel's
      no-tidy-up precedent). The collapsed flag is the panel's one piece of
      local state, like FindBar's own open/closed. Vitest +3 cases
      (round-trip with hidden-not-unmounted body, the readout flip, the
      staged re-expand); controls + tour READMEs updated. *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-18; shipped 2026-07-18.)*
- [x] **A query-analyst toggle in the search bar — and rename "Filters"**
      *(v5.18.0)* — the search surface gave no way to skip the query-analyst
      agent; sometimes you want the raw keyword search without the LLM
      expansion round-trip (or its spend). Shipped as the ticket sketched: a
      checkbox in the popover, which therefore stopped being "Filters" — of
      the floated names ("Search options" / "Options" / sparkle-icon button)
      plain **"Options"** won against the mock, since the button sits inside
      the search form and the context is already there. Backend:
      `live_search(analyst=)` + `/api/search?analyst=0|false|no` — off skips
      `_analyze` *and* the recalled-title verification on both provider
      paths and runs the lexical search on the words as typed; the day-long
      result cache now keys on the flag too (a raw search and an expanded
      search must never serve each other's entries). Frontend:
      `SearchFilters` → `SearchOptions` (`analyst: true` in the defaults),
      the switch counts toward the button's badge (a closed popover still
      shows the next search behaves differently) and survives a provider
      switch; "Clear all" became **"Reset"**, since it now turns a checkbox
      back *on*. The browser round added a one-line "why" hint under the
      checkbox — the search only matches words, so "DQN" misses papers that
      never spell it out — Patrick's verdict: "a bit verbose, but necessary
      to explain". Tour step, tooltips, and the READMEs across both trees
      updated in the same change. Suite 522 → 526 backend. *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-17; shipped 2026-07-18.)*
- [x] **One "Abstract" section in the detail panel, with a TL;DR toggle**
      *(v5.17.0)* — the ticket's premise turned out half-stale (the panel
      already rendered ONE section showing TL;DR *or* abstract), so what
      shipped is the real gap: **abstract-first on both providers, with
      in-section Abstract | TL;DR tabs** — and a TL;DR for papers that have
      none. A new **`summarizer` micro-agent** (`agents/summarizer/`, the
      query_analyst mold: Haiku, structured output, None-on-any-failure; own
      config entry + README) writes one plain-language sentence from
      title + abstract — the digest era's "summarize" button reborn.
      **Billing is structural, per Patrick's rule** ("don't bill my Anthropic
      account for papers I don't read"): generation runs ONLY on the panel's
      explicit ✦-marked TL;DR tab click (`POST /api/paper/tldr` — the sole
      code path that can reach the model; builds/traversals/hydration
      can't), and the result caches **permanently** by node id
      (`tldr:v1:<id>` in `data/digest.db`), so each paper bills at most one
      Haiku call ever. Cached summaries ride ordinary hydration for free
      (`api_paper` back-fills the hole but never overwrites a provider's
      native TLDR) — and keying by node id makes the path provider-agnostic,
      so S2 papers S2 never summarized get the ✦ treatment too. Frontend:
      `SummarySection` in `DetailPanel` (tabs, pending "Summarizing…",
      in-place error with the abstract a tab away, ✦ tooltip naming the
      one-time cost), `useSelection.mergeDetail`, `api.generateTldr`. Tour's
      detail stop rewritten (twice — Patrick smoothing the copy). Suite
      511 → 521 backend, 131 → 135 frontend. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-16; shipped 2026-07-18 — the last of the four-item UI slate.)*
- [x] **Lexical search over the nodes on screen** *(v5.16.0)* — a keyword find
      for papers **already on the graph** (titles/authors), fully separate from
      the seed search that fetches new ones. Purely lexical and local:
      `model.findMatches` runs a case-insensitive substring match over the
      *visible* view (a filtered-out paper can't match invisibly), and
      GraphExplorer routes the matches through the teacher's highlight
      machinery — matches glow + label, everything else dims, zero hits dims
      the whole graph (honest no-match feedback), and clearing hands the glow
      back to the teacher. The surface took three browser iterations to land
      (each Patrick's call): a box *inside* the graph controls (crowded) → an
      always-open rounded pill top-right (blended into the Timeline axis, then
      floated in no-man's land) → the shipped **collapsed round 🔍 button**
      top-right that expands into a focused pill on click, Google-Maps style.
      A live query pins the pill open; ✕ / Esc / blur-while-empty tuck it back.
      Esc-in-box clears the query first (the global Esc-clears-all skips form
      controls); the clear-all gesture and a new graph reset it too. New tour
      stop; `FindBar.tsx` + tests, `findMatches` tests. *(From the `todos.md`
      inbox, 2026-07-13; shipped 2026-07-18. Moved to the bottom-right corner,
      mirroring the legend, in v5.18.1 — the fallback spot agreed when
      top-right shipped.)*
- [x] **Source-scope picker doesn't appear until a page refresh (+ note it
      above the ask bar)** *(v5.15.0)* — `Teacher.tsx` fetched the library
      once, in a mount-only effect, into local state; an upload in the 📚
      Sources drawer never refreshed it, so the picker (shown at >1 source)
      stayed hidden until a manual reload. Fixed the way the ticket predicted:
      the source list moved into a new **`library` store slice** (the store's
      fourth) that the drawer re-loads through on every upload/URL
      ingest/delete and the panel reads live — mirroring how the
      lecture-scope picker reads `transcript.lectures`. The panel's scope
      choices also flipped to **exclusion-tracking** (`excludedSources`, like
      `excludedLectures`), so a source uploaded after the user last touched
      the picker is searchable by default; a `loaded` flag keeps the panel's
      per-epoch remounts from re-fetching. The ask-bar note is now one
      combined line — *"Answers also draw on 2 played lectures (🎓) · 3
      sources (📚)"* — shown whenever either is in play, graph or
      library-only mode. Browser testing surfaced a latent popover bug the
      newly-usable picker exposed: with a subset checked, "Select all" +
      "Deselect all" both render and overflowed the 240px popover (heading
      wrapped, ✕ off-view, horizontal scrollbar) — bulk actions are now
      compact **All / None** links, the popover is `overflow-x: hidden`, and
      the header no-wraps. Suite 116 → 121. *(Patrick's report, 2026-07-11;
      shipped 2026-07-17.)*
- [x] **One fast "unhighlight everything" action** *(v5.14.0)* — clearing what's
      lit on the graph was piecemeal: the hand-picked selection had its own
      Clear, and a lit lecture beat / chat answer / inline `[n]` ref cleared by
      clicking it again. Now **Esc** (new `useEscapeClear` hook — skips form
      controls, and defers to the lightbox's and tour's own Esc-to-close) and
      the controls' `clear` link both run one `onClearAll`:
      `nodeSelectionCleared()` + `highlightSet([])`. The teacher panel's
      active beat/answer/ref marks follow the emptied global highlight on
      their own (`useConversation` watches the set — which also fixes a latent
      staleness where a graph reload killed the glow but left a beat looking
      lit). The controls row now shows "**N lit** · clear" when only the
      teacher's glow is active, the gesture hint teaches `esc clears all
      highlights`, and the tour's scope stop teaches Esc too. *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-14; shipped 2026-07-17.)*
- [x] **Thicker dashed ring for "Discovered by teacher" nodes** *(v5.14.0)* —
      the ring was hard to see for a *painting* reason, not just a width one:
      it stroked the node fill's own arc, burying half its 1.2px line under
      the disc. It now draws on its own path just outside the fill
      (radius + 1.5) at width 2, brighter (alpha 0.6 → 0.9), dash 3/2 — and
      restores the fill's arc as the current path so the lit/pinned/selected
      rings after it are untouched. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-14;
      shipped 2026-07-17.)*
- [x] **Release re-condenses a scattered force layout on demand — and keeps
      your zoom** *(v5.14.0)* — Release was disabled with nothing pinned, so
      the only way to pull a drifted force graph back together was abusing a
      filter chip's reheat side effect. Now always enabled: unpins everything
      (Timeline keeps its date columns) and `d3ReheatSimulation`s. Patrick's
      browser pass added the second half: releasing used to re-arm the
      one-shot `fitDone` latch, so the engine-stop re-ran `zoomToFit` and
      yanked the camera out to the whole graph — it no longer does, matching
      the discovery merge's "reheat without camera yank" rule. The tour's
      actions stop now says so. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-11;
      shipped 2026-07-17.)*
- [x] **Hide dateless papers in Timeline, keep them in Force** *(shipped
      inside v5.5.0; ticket retired 2026-07-17)* — filed 2026-07-11, then
      solved en passant by v5.5.0's landmark work: `GraphExplorer.nodeOk`
      drops `year == null` nodes (and, via the visible-set intersection,
      their edges) from the Timeline view only, Force still shows them, and
      the count readout reads the filtered view — everything the ticket
      asked for. Sat unnoticed in the Backlog until the v5.14.0 quick-wins
      batch went looking and found the work already done (with its own test
      pinning the behavior). *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-11.)*
- [x] **Guided help tour (coach-mark modal) for the graph tools** *(v5.9.0)* — a
      stepped, spotlight-style onboarding overlay launched from an
      always-present header **"?" button**, walking the user through the app's
      controls one at a time: an anchored bubble dims the rest of the screen
      (the dimming is the spotlight's 200vmax box-shadow, so there's exactly
      one hole), rings the relevant control, and shows **Back / Next**, a step
      counter, a **jump select** (every stop's title, numbered — skip straight
      to any tip instead of Next-ing through the walk), **Skip tips**, and a
      **✕** — the Yotpo-style product tour Patrick mocked up. Shipped as the
      reusable, data-driven component the ticket asked for (`tour/Tour.tsx`
      over a `steps.ts` array of `{ target selector, title, body }`,
      positioning each bubble off the target's bounding rect, clamped into the
      viewport, and skipping steps whose target is absent or hidden — so one
      list describes the maximal tour), plus what the build grew: **two
      phases** with their own localStorage seen-flags (**HOME_TOUR** auto-runs
      once on first launch over the search surface; **GRAPH_TOUR** once on the
      first graph over the graph tools — the "?" re-runs whichever fits what's
      on screen), **staged steps** (`stage:` — the tour opens the
      Library/Assistant/Sessions drawers and the detail panel itself, polling
      briefly for the just-mounted target; `presentIf` proxies gate stops
      whose own target only exists after staging), targets marked by greppable
      `data-tour="…"` attributes planted where the controls render, arrow-key
      / Esc navigation (arrows defer to the jump select while it has focus),
      and re-measuring on resize and capture-phase scroll. The first
      motivation is honored — the node-selector's alt-drag / shift-click /
      alt-click gestures get their own stop — and the researcher stop
      re-states the grounding contract (the papers you've selected, else every
      visible one) for emphasis. 10 jsdom/RTL tests (`test/tour/Tour.test.tsx`)
      pin the walking, absent-target skipping, staging, jump select, and all
      three quit paths. *(From the node-selector session, 2026-07-12.)*
- [x] **Rename the "Sources" button to "Library"** *(v5.3.1)* — the top-bar
      toggle reads **📚 Library**, and the drawer's own heading/aria-label
      followed ("Your sources" → "Your library") so the button and what it
      opens agree. **User-facing copy only**: the noted naming tension resolved
      as label-over-rename — the feature stays `sources` in code
      (`SourcesConfig`, `/api/sources`, the `Sources` component,
      `onOpenSources`, `sources-toggle`) to keep the "library"-vs-Python-
      packages ambiguity out of identifiers; the header and library READMEs
      document the label↔name mapping. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-14.)*
- [x] **The assistant's two scope popovers shouldn't overlap** *(v5.3.2, bug)* —
      the AI-teacher header's two `ScopePicker`s ("🎓 All lectures" and "📚 All
      sources") could both be open at once, their popovers overlapping
      illegibly (screenshotted 2026-07-14); each picker held its own `open` in
      component-local `useState`, so nothing coordinated them. Fixed by making
      the picker **controlled** (`open`/`onOpenChange` props) with `Teacher.tsx`
      owning one shared slot (`openScope: 'lectures' | 'sources' | null`) —
      opening either closes the other. Also added a **✕ close button** in the
      popover header next to "Deselect all" (re-clicking the trigger still
      closes too). The controlled contract is pinned by 3 new RTL tests
      (`test/teacher/ScopePicker.test.tsx`, the suite's third jsdom file —
      with the explicit `afterEach(cleanup)` the no-globals setup needs).
      *(Patrick's browser find, 2026-07-14.)*
- [x] **Node selector tool that scopes the lectures and Q&A agents** *(v4.13.0)* —
      **hand-pick which nodes** the teacher works over, right on the graph. An
      **alt-drag marquee** (a transparent overlay that arms only while Alt is
      held, so it captures the drag without fighting react-force-graph's
      pan) sweeps up the enclosed **visible** nodes via screen-space
      hit-testing (`fgRef.graph2ScreenCoords`), and **shift-click** toggles a
      single node. The pick is **additive** — each sweep unions onto it, so
      several clusters build one scope; **alt-click** empty canvas or the
      controls' **Clear** resets it. Picked nodes ring **cyan** and the rest
      **dim**. The pick lives in the workspace slice (`selectedNodeIds`) and
      threads into grounding through `selectGroundingNodes`, which now
      **intersects** it with the filters: grounding = `(selected ∩ visible) ∪
      discoveries`, so hiding a relation after picking also drops those nodes
      (discoveries are always kept). Both the lecture (`streamLecture`) and the
      Q&A researcher (`streamAsk`) already send `nodes: groundingNodes`, so no
      payload plumbing changed — the selection just narrows what they see. The
      controls carry an always-on gesture hint and a picked-count/Clear row;
      the assistant panel notes an active pick above the ask box. *(Design
      calls, made with Patrick: intersect-not-replace for the filter interplay;
      an **additive** marquee rather than an Alt+Shift "replace vs. add" split —
      Alt+Shift is the OS keyboard-layout switch on Windows and can't be used
      mid-drag; see the Bugs log. A guided **help tour** to teach these gestures
      was split into its own backlog ticket below.) *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-11.)*
- [x] **Colour-coded lecture buttons + a two-view assistant panel** *(v4.11.0)* —
      a full pass over the assistant panel, tying each lecture to the nodes it
      narrates and de-cluttering the whole surface. **Buttons are colour-coded to
      their relation** (`MODES` in `Teacher.tsx`, `--c` from `REL_COLOR`, the same
      hex as the filter chips / legend dots): "How we got here" blue (references),
      "What's evolved since" green (landmark citers — **renamed** back from the
      v4.8.0 "The landmark papers since" now the colour carries it), "The current
      frontier" light green (latest), "This paper's intuition" gold (seed). Each
      button shows **only its short node-type word, centred** (References /
      Landmarks / Latest / This paper); the full lecture name moved to the
      tooltip + aria-label and to a **"Now playing" header** above the transcript
      (tinted the relation's colour). The lecture section is ruled off under the
      panel title with a divider + one-line intro. **Two views, one panel**
      (gated on `activeMode`): a shown lecture takes over the scroll (header +
      beats), otherwise it's the Q&A chat — asking a question hides the lecture
      (kept cached) so beats and chat never stack. **The Landmarks green was
      darkened** graph-wide (`REL_COLOR.citation` `#4ade80`→`#22c55e`) to separate
      it from Latest's pale green, and the detail-panel badges gained
      `BADGE_COLOR` / `BADGE_LABEL`: both citing relations (`citation` + `latest`)
      now read as **one "citation" badge** in the original in-between `#4ade80`
      (Latest Publications ARE citing papers), deduped so a node never shows it
      twice. Shipped with a backend fix found while testing — concurrent lecture
      streams hit "Event loop is closed" (see [Bugs](bugs.md)).
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-11; browser-tested.)*
- [x] **Clickable reference numbers in agent answers** *(v3.8.0)* — inline `[n]`
      markers are now clickable chips that spotlight the paper they cite (the
      `highlightIds` glow); click the same marker again to clear it. Works on
      **both** surfaces: researcher answers (resolved frontend-side against the
      grounding list + idx-tagged discoveries) and **lecture beats** (resolved
      server-side by `prompts.refs_from_text`, emitted on the beat's new `refs`
      field — a lecture numbers the mode-filtered `_story_nodes` the frontend
      never sees). The resolved `[n]`→node-id map persists per message/beat, so
      it survives a saved-session reload. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-07.)*
- [x] **Adjustable side panels** *(v3.7.0)* — both docked panels (detail +
      assistant) are now user-resizable: a drag handle on each panel's inner
      edge (`ui/useResizablePanel.ts`), width clamped 280–680px and remembered
      across sessions in localStorage (`atlas.detailWidth` / `atlas.teacherWidth`).
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-08.)*
- [x] **Q&A answers need full Markdown + LaTeX rendering** *(v3.8.0)* — agent
      prose now renders through **react-markdown** (`AnswerMarkdown.tsx`):
      remark-gfm (headers, **bold**, lists, tables) + remark-math + rehype-katex
      (the KaTeX the app already uses), with a small `remarkCite` plugin for the
      clickable `[n]` markers above. Reused for **both** researcher answers and
      lecture beats; `MathText` stays for the detail panel, search hits, and beat
      headings. The user's own question bubble stays plain (no Markdown
      surprises). *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-08.)*
- [x] **Multi-number citation markers now highlight** *(v4.9.1)* — an agent
      answer that wrote a combined marker like `[14, 29]` used to be inert
      (clicking it highlighted nothing): the whole `[n]` pipeline matched single
      numbers only, so a combined marker never became a chip. Fixed **both**
      ways the ticket floated — the marker regex is now
      `\[(\d+(?:[\s,]+\d+)*)\]` (comma- and/or space-separated) in all three
      places that must agree (`remarkCite` render, `useConversation.resolveRefs`,
      backend `prompts.refs_from_text`), splitting a combined marker into **one
      clickable chip per index** (each resolving to its own paper); **and** the
      `numbered-papers.md` skill now tells agents to emit separate `[14][29]`
      markers, not combined, so the split rarely even fires. Verified with a new
      RTL test that renders the real `AnswerMarkdown` and clicks each chip.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-10.)*
- [x] **Lecture buttons: cached toggles, tidied grid, parallel loading**
      *(v4.9.0)* — the lecture-mode buttons were reworked end-to-end (shipping
      the "tidy the buttons" and "cache each lecture" asks together):
  - **Cached show/hide toggles** — each of the four modes caches its beats on
    first play (`store/transcript.ts`: `lectures` = mode → beats, plus
    `activeMode`); re-clicking the shown mode hides it (cache kept), clicking a
    played-but-hidden mode reloads instantly with no re-fetch. Save persists the
    whole per-mode cache (a restore brings every played lecture back, not just
    the visible one; a pre-caching save's flat `beats` folds into `history`).
  - **Everything streams in parallel** — the single "teaching" flag/shared abort
    controller became one controller per in-flight lecture (`Map<mode, ctrl>`)
    plus one for the chat, so a lecture keeps generating in the background when
    you deselect it, ask a question, or start another mode — nothing interrupts
    anything else. `beatAdded` carries its mode so a background stream fills the
    right slot; `onBeat` only drives the graph highlight for the shown mode.
  - **Tidied 2×2 grid** — even equal-height cells (long labels wrap cleanly), a
    **filled periwinkle** selected state, a small dot on a cached-but-hidden
    mode, and **hopping "loading" dots** (cascade animation, honors
    `prefers-reduced-motion`) on a streaming button.
  - **Soft periwinkle palette** — the panel's hard `#ffd166` yellow (buttons,
    active-beat/answer tints, trace chips) swapped for a soft periwinkle
    (`--lecture` / `--lecture-solid` in `teacher.css`), easier on the eyes and
    in the app's blue-accent family. *(Browser-caught + fixed: hover was washing
    out the filled `.active` fill on specificity — scoped hover off `.active`.)*
  - **Contextual Clear**, relocated to a **transcript toolbar** (top-right of
    the content zone, out of the lecture controls): a shown lecture → clear just
    that lecture (`lectureDropped`); no lecture shown → clear the Q&A chat
    (`chatCleared`) and mint a fresh session. The button relabels accordingly.
  - **"The landmark papers since"** — the evolution mode renamed from
    "Summarize the landmark papers since".
  - **Grounding-scope caption** — a quiet note under the grid tells the user a
    lecture covers exactly the papers currently shown on the graph (so filtering
    the graph scopes the lecture). Verified in the browser via Playwright on the
    cached DQN seed. *(Patrick's asks, browser-tested 2026-07-11.)*
- [x] **Drop the per-relation count sliders; filter by citation count instead**
      *(v4.7.0)* — the four per-node-type count sliders are gone; the **relation
      filter chips** (restyled back to the bubbly v2–v3 pills) are now the only
      node-*type* filter. In their place, a **dual-knob citation-count window
      slider** sits beneath the year slider: two thumbs bound a min…max citation
      window on a **log scale** (`model.ts` `citationThreshold`, `log1p`/`expm1`),
      bounded by the graph's *actual* min…max neighbor citation counts — like the
      year slider's real-range bounds — so neither knob idles. It's a pure
      *display* filter over the already citation-budgeted pool (`cite_budget`
      model), not a fetch control; hidden when the neighbors share one citation
      count (nothing to window). **Config cleanup, resolved: keep**
      `graph.cite_limit` / `adaptive_cite_limit`. The OnePager's "(slider max)"
      was a misread — they're the ceiling for the adaptive landmark-budget model
      (`services/graph/budget.py`, `build.py`), independent of the retired
      frontend sliders, so nothing was redundant. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-10.)*
- [x] **Determinate "Building graph…" progress** *(v3.7.0)* — the build notice
      now shows a real filling bar + live stage label, not just a spinner. As
      predicted, this took a streaming build route: new SSE `GET
      /api/graph/stream` bridges `build_graph`'s five coarse stages (resolve →
      references → citations → similar → assemble) into `progress`/`done`/`error`
      frames via a worker thread + queue (the Sources-ingest pattern), and
      `loadGraph` consumes them into a `buildProgress` store field. A cache hit
      streams no frames, so it stays instant. Covers **both** load paths — a
      fresh build from an empty workspace and a re-seed over an existing graph
      (a restored save rebuilds locally, so it needs no bar). The blocking
      `GET /api/graph` stays for compatibility. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-08.)*
- [x] **Remove the "Powered by Claude" attribution** *(v5.3.1)* — the v1.11.0
      top-bar credit (starburst SVG + anthropic.com link) removed, with its
      `.cc-credit` CSS and README/comment mentions. *(From the `todos.md`
      inbox, 2026-07-08.)*

### Infrastructure, quality & tooling

- [x] **`urllib3` 2.7.0 → 2.8.0** *(v8.4.0)* — two HIGH CVEs
      (CVE-2026-97687, HTTPS-proxy TLS override; CVE-2026-97689, unbounded
      chunk-parser allocation) published against the transitive `urllib3`
      and failed the `security` session mid-feature. `uv lock
      --upgrade-package urllib3`, nothing else moved. The gate did exactly
      what v8.2.0 made it able to do.

- [x] **`astronaut --version`, and the environment rules that block a tag**
      *(v8.3.0)* — two small things caught in the act of publishing, before
      anything reached PyPI.

      **`--version` did not exist.** The CLI answered `--help` but printed usage
      for `--version`, which is the first thing anyone tries when filing a bug
      against a published package. Added as
      `@click.version_option(package_name="curious-astronaut", …)`, which reads
      **installed package metadata** rather than a second copy of the number in
      the source — so `pyproject.toml` stays the only place a release bumps, and
      a checkout reports the same string as a wheel. Verified by bumping: the
      flag went from 8.2.0 to 8.3.0 with no source change. Two tests guard the
      wiring (that it matches `importlib.metadata`, and that `--help`
      advertises it) rather than the number, so a bump never edits a test. The
      rebrand's last two stragglers went with it: `cli.py`'s docstring still
      described "the `atlas` console script" and suggested `uv run atlas --help`.

      **A `v*` tag cannot deploy to an environment whose rules name a branch.**
      The v8.2.0 release failed with *"Tag "v8.2.0" is not allowed to deploy to
      testpypi due to environment protection rules"* — a tag is not a branch
      ref, so a rule listing `main` never matches it, and `pypi needs testpypi`
      took the whole release down. Both environments now carry an explicit
      **tag rule `v*`**: `testpypi` has that *plus* branch `main`, because it
      runs on both the manual dispatch and the tag; `pypi` has the tag rule
      alone, deliberately, so nothing but a tag can reach PyPI. See
      [bugs.md](bugs.md) — the same misconfiguration bit twice, first pointing
      at a `test` branch and then at `main`, which is what makes it worth
      recording.

      **v8.2.0 therefore never reached PyPI**: its release run died at the
      TestPyPI gate, so 8.3.0 is the first version published. 8.2.0 exists on
      TestPyPI (from the manual rehearsal) and as a git tag. It was not reused
      for this fix on purpose — TestPyPI already held 8.2.0, and
      `skip-existing: true` would have quietly kept the old files, breaking the
      one property the rehearsal exists to provide: that what was tested is
      byte-for-byte what ships. *(Shipped 2026-09-27.)*

- [x] **Make the security gate able to fail; clear a CRITICAL CVE** *(v8.2.0)* —
      found while reading the *first* CI logs anyone had actually been able to
      read (`gh` was pinned in the same release). `noxfile.py` ran
      `trivy fs --scanners vuln,secret .` with **no `--exit-code`**, and Trivy
      exits 0 by default whether or not it finds anything — so the session's
      "success" only ever meant *trivy finished*. A CRITICAL `anyio` CVE
      (CVE-2026-63374, fixed in 4.14.2) printed inside three consecutive green
      gates and shipped in v8.1.0 anyway.

      Now two runs with opposite policies, because the scanners need them.
      **Vulnerabilities fail the gate** at `HIGH,CRITICAL`; MEDIUM and LOW still
      print without blocking, keeping the bar at severities worth interrupting
      work for. **Secrets only report**, skipping `config.json` and `.env` —
      both gitignored, both *meant* to hold live keys, so failing on them would
      leave the gate permanently red on any machine that has run the app, while
      a key in a **tracked** file is still caught. That asymmetry is also what
      hid the bug: the scan always ended with a secret hit on the local config,
      so a passing run always looked alarming, which trained everyone reading it
      to skim. `anyio` went to **4.15.1** in the same change, clearing both its
      CVEs (a HIGH, CVE-2026-63349, came along with the CRITICAL).

      The exit code was verified by making it fail on purpose — re-running with
      the bar at MEDIUM, where a `setuptools` finding sits, and confirming a
      return of 1 — rather than trusting the flag. Remaining findings are a
      MEDIUM (`setuptools`, an sdist `MANIFEST.in` bypass, not our build path
      since we use hatchling) and a LOW (`torch`). Full story and the two
      habits it argues for in [bugs.md](bugs.md). *(Shipped 2026-09-27.)*

- [x] **Release automation: `release.yml` builds and publishes to PyPI**
      *(v8.2.0)* — the second of the release ticket's three stages (CI shipped
      in v6.10.0; deploy is still open). Pushing a `v*` tag now runs
      version-check → build → TestPyPI → PyPI, and the manual trigger publishes
      to TestPyPI on demand so the pipeline can be exercised without cutting a
      tag. Four decisions are load-bearing.

      **Trusted publishing, not an API token.** PyPI removed password uploads in
      2024, leaving API tokens or OIDC. The workflow uses OIDC: `id-token: write`
      lets the runner mint a short-lived token that PyPI verifies against a
      publisher config naming the repo, **the workflow filename, and the job's
      environment**. Nothing secret is stored, so there is nothing to leak or
      rotate — and no credential ever has to exist on a developer machine, which
      is what made this the right shape rather than a convenience. The cost is a
      coupling that is invisible from the repo: **renaming `release.yml` or
      either environment breaks publishing** until PyPI is updated to match.

      **TestPyPI is not skippable.** A PyPI version can never be replaced, only
      yanked, so `pypi` `needs: testpypi` and the dispatch input offers only
      `testpypi` or `both` — there is deliberately no path to PyPI that skips the
      dry run in the same run. `skip-existing: true` on the TestPyPI upload keeps
      a re-run from failing on a version it already has. The real upload also
      sits behind a GitHub **environment**, which is where a required reviewer
      turns the irreversible step into a deliberate click — and whose deployment
      rule permits only `v*` tags, so **a tag is the one and only route to
      PyPI**. The manual trigger therefore takes no inputs: an option to publish
      for real would be a button the environment always rejects. Because
      `testpypi` and `pypi` both consume the *same* artifact from one `build`
      job, the rehearsal is byte-for-byte what gets published — a property that
      an earlier plan to run TestPyPI from a separate branch would have quietly
      destroyed, since a run has exactly one ref and the two uploads would then
      have been different builds.

      **`npm run build` before `uv build`, asserted rather than assumed.**
      `hatch_build.py` bundles the frontend only when it exists, and *must*
      tolerate its absence (hatchling hard-fails on a missing force-include
      source, which would break `uv sync` on a fresh clone). The price of that
      tolerance is that the wrong order produces a **valid** wheel that serves
      the "Frontend not built yet" hint. So a `Verify artifacts` step opens both
      archives and asserts the bundle landed, `config.example.json` is present,
      and the sdist still carries `frontend/src`.

      **The secret audit is now machine-checked.** The same step fails the build
      if either artifact contains `config.json`, `.env`, `.pypirc`, anything
      under `data/`, or a `.db`/`.log` file. This existed only as a habit before:
      `config.json` is gitignored and holds **live API keys** (Trivy flags it
      every run), the sdist's allowlist `include` is the only thing keeping it
      out, and an upload cannot be taken back. Both failure modes were tested by
      constructing bad wheels — one stripped of `_frontend/`, one with a
      `config.json` injected — and confirming the guard rejects each.

      **`gh` is now pinned in `.tool-versions`** as part of this, so the
      bootstrap installs it and a session can actually read its own CI results
      (`gh run view`). Until now nobody could: the v8.0.0 CI run was never
      checked because `gh` wasn't on PATH. Authentication stays out of band —
      `gh auth login` puts the token in gh's own credential store, so no
      credential is ever pasted into a transcript.

      Also corrected here: the v8.1.0 note claiming the legacy
      `license = { file = … }` form was kept for metadata compatibility. It
      isn't — hatchling emits `Metadata-Version: 2.5` either way. See that
      entry, now amended. **The first attempt at this workflow also failed in
      CI**, on `uv build` refusing a `UV_CACHE_DIR` inside the build source
      directory — the pattern was copied from `ci.yml`, which only runs
      `uv sync`/`uv run` and so never trips it. Noted in the header and in
      CLAUDE.md so the "inconsistency" doesn't get tidied back up.

- [x] **Package for PyPI: bundled frontend, installed-layout paths, metadata**
      *(v8.1.0)* — the packaging half of the "Publish to PyPI" ticket, split off
      once the rebrand settled the name. Three things stood between an editable
      checkout and an installable wheel, and all three only break *after*
      installation, which is why nothing in the suite had caught them.

      **(1) The built frontend now ships inside the wheel.** `frontend/dist`
      lands as `curious_astronaut/_frontend/` (64 files), and `app.py` prefers
      that copy while still falling back to the checkout's `frontend/dist`, so
      `npm run build` keeps taking effect in development without a reinstall.
      It goes in through a **custom build hook** (`hatch_build.py`), not a plain
      `force-include`, for a specific reason: hatchling *fails the build* when a
      force-include source is missing, and `frontend/dist` is gitignored — so on
      a fresh clone `uv sync`, which runs the build backend **before**
      `bin/setup` gets to `npm run build`, would die. The hook looks first and
      skips quietly. The consequence to remember when release automation lands:
      **a wheel built without `npm run build` first serves the "Frontend not
      built yet" hint instead of the app.**

      **(2) Path resolution became two-mode.** The old anchor was
      `Path(__file__).parents[2]`, which is the repo root from
      `src/curious_astronaut/` and pure nonsense from
      `site-packages/curious_astronaut/` — it walked off the end of the layout
      and pointed at `lib/python3.14/`. `config.py` now detects a source
      checkout by requiring **both** a `pyproject.toml` and a `src/` dir two
      levels up (`CHECKOUT_ROOT`); `PROJECT_ROOT` is that root in a checkout and
      a `platformdirs` per-user data dir otherwise. The distinction that matters
      is **writable state (`PROJECT_ROOT`) versus shipped assets
      (`PACKAGE_DIR`)** — `config.json`, `data/` and the logs are state and must
      never accumulate in site-packages, while `config.example.json` is an asset
      and is force-included into the package. An editable install still reads as
      a checkout, so development is byte-identical: `PROJECT_ROOT`,
      `CONFIG_PATH`, `data_dir` and `FRONTEND_DIST` all resolve exactly where
      they did before.

      **(3) PyPI metadata.** Keywords, 15 classifiers, and the four
      `[project.urls]` entries. `license = { file = "LICENSE" }` was left in the
      legacy form rather than modernised to PEP 639's `license = "MIT"`.
      **The original reason for that was wrong and is corrected here:** the
      thinking was that PEP 639 emits metadata 2.4 and an Artifactory/Xray
      scanner of unknown vintage might balk. The built wheel reports
      `Metadata-Version: 2.5` either way — hatchling's current version emits
      2.5 regardless of which license form is used — so the legacy form buys no
      compatibility at all. The only real difference is that the full licence
      text is embedded in the metadata instead of an SPDX
      `License-Expression: MIT`. Keeping it is therefore a *neutral* choice, not
      a defensive one, and not worth a version bump to change; the
      `License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License` classifier carries the same
      information regardless. Lesson worth more than the detail: **a
      compatibility argument about generated metadata should be checked against
      the generated metadata**, which takes one `unzip -p` and was not done.

      **Verified by installing it, not by reading it.** The ticket's predicted
      failure was reproduced first — a wheel in a clean venv died with
      `FileNotFoundError: .../lib/python3.14/config.example.json` — then the fix
      was checked the same way, including the non-editable `pip install .` the
      ticket named: `/api/health`, `/` (the real SPA) and `/favicon.svg` all
      200, with `config.json` created under
      `~/Library/Application Support/curious-astronaut`. One more trap surfaced
      there: **`uv build` builds the wheel from the sdist**, so a wheel built
      through it inherited the sdist's exclusions and shipped no frontend at
      all. Fixed with `artifacts = ["frontend/dist/**"]` plus `frontend/dist` in
      the sdist include list — shipping build output in an sdist is unusual, but
      the alternative is requiring npm at install time, and it also makes
      `pip install <sdist>` work, which is what the Artifactory path actually
      serves. Guarded by **13 new tests** in `test/test_packaging.py` (the build
      hook's present/absent behavior, the both-markers checkout rule, and the
      pyproject wiring the wheel silently depends on). *(Shipped 2026-09-27.)*

- [x] **Rebrand: Atlas → Curious Astronaut** *(v8.0.0)* — the PyPI
      distribution-name question turned into a rebrand. Three things forced it.
      (1) **`atlas` was unavailable and uncrowdable** — the PyPI name is held by
      an active project (danijar's "Interactive environments for AI agents",
      last release 2024-12-07), so PEP 541 was off the table and every candidate
      needed a qualifier. (2) **Every qualifier re-narrowed the product**:
      `papers-atlas`, `citation-atlas`, `atlas-graph` all name the *artifact*
      the app renders. (3) **The map metaphor was a ceiling.** Atlas capped the
      product at things that are map-shaped, when the app already runs without a
      graph at all — `services/sources` lets the teacher answer from an uploaded
      textbook, and every exploration has a permanent General discussion. A name
      should name the relationship, not the object on screen; an astronaut is
      the explorer, not the map. "arXiv Atlas" was already vestigial: `README.md`
      said only "Atlas" and mentioned arXiv twice, both incidental.

      Shipped as a 248-file sweep (199 renames): `src/atlas/` →
      `src/curious_astronaut/`, `test/atlas/` → `test/curious_astronaut/`,
      dist name `curious-astronaut`, **CLI `atlas` → `astronaut`**
      (`astronaut serve`), `data/atlas.log` → `data/curious-astronaut.log`,
      `ATLAS_SKIP_TORCH` → `CA_SKIP_TORCH` (CI + both setup scripts), User-Agent
      strings, every package README, and the brand prose throughout. Frontend:
      `Atlas.tsx` → **`App.tsx`** and `atlas.css` → `app.css` — `Shell.tsx` was
      tried first and rejected because `frontend/src/shell/` and
      `frontend/src/shell/shell.css` already exist and macOS's case-insensitive
      filesystem would have made `./Shell` ambiguous; `App` is brand-neutral, so
      a future rebrand never touches it again. `AtlasConfig` → `AppConfig`,
      `.atlas*` CSS classes → `.shell-*`, localStorage keys `atlas.*` → `ca.*`
      (a one-time reset of rail-open, detail-panel width and build shape), and
      `favicon.svg` became the new helmet mark — ivory shell, deep glass,
      gold `^_^`, citation graph ghosted into the visor.

      **Major, not minor:** the CLI name, package name, log path and stored
      prefs all break for an existing install. Two latent bugs surfaced and were
      fixed en route — the User-Agent URLs still pointed at
      `github.com/patrickjames0132/arxiv-digest`, stale since the 2026-07-17
      rename (see [bugs.md](bugs.md)), and CLAUDE.md's "quick backend check"
      imported `app` from `app.py`, which has only ever exported `create_app`.

      *(Settled 2026-09-23, shipped 2026-09-25.)*

- [x] **Rename `digest.db` → `cache.db`** *(v7.22.1)* — the ephemeral graph-snapshot store
      is still named `digest.db`, a leftover from the retired daily-digest era;
      it's really the 1-day graph/artifact **cache** now. Rename the file (and
      the `storage.data_dir`-relative path + any `config`/docstring references,
      e.g. `storage/sessions.py`'s note contrasting it with `sessions.db`) so the
      name matches what it holds. A cosmetic rename — old `digest.db` files can be
      left to age out or deleted, since it's a regenerable cache. *(From the
      `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-11.)* Shipped: `StorageConfig.digest_db` →
      `cache_db`, the file is `cache.db`; every docstring/README/CLAUDE.md
      mention followed. Old `digest.db` files can just be deleted.
- [x] **Rename the `data/oa_pdfs/` PDF cache — "oa" reads as OpenAlex, means
      open-access** *(v7.22.1)* — `services/pdf/fetch.py` caches downloaded PDFs under
      `data_dir/oa_pdfs` (hash-named, LRU-pruned beyond `config.pdf.cache_files`).
      The `oa_` prefix is meant as *open-access* but reads as *OpenAlex*, which
      misleads — the cache is provider-agnostic (any paper's open-access PDF,
      mined for figures/full text). Rename to something unambiguous (`pdfs/`,
      `pdf_cache/`), updating `fetch.py` and the `services/pdf/README.md`
      references; old `oa_pdfs/` dirs can age out (it's a regenerable cache).
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-20.)* Shipped: now
      `data_dir/pdf_cache/`, with the reason kept in `services/pdf/README.md` so
      the name doesn't drift back.
- [x] **Move `check_identifiers.py` out of `bin/` to the project root** *(v7.22.1)* — the
      no-single-letter-identifiers AST hook lives in `bin/check_identifiers.py`,
      but it's repo-level tooling like `noxfile.py`, which sits at the root; move
      it alongside. Updates the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` `entry`
      (`uv run --no-sync python bin/check_identifiers.py`) and the two CLAUDE.md
      references. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-20.)* Shipped: moved to
      the root beside `noxfile.py`; the pre-commit `entry`, the script's usage
      docstring, CLAUDE.md and `frontend/src/README.md` all point at the new
      path.
- [x] **PyMuPDF is an optional extra — the one AGPL dependency is out of the
      default install** *(v7.15.0)* — a license audit of the installed tree
      (2026-08-09) came back clean everywhere except one: `pymupdf` is **"Dual
      Licensed - GNU AFFERO GPL 3.0 or Artifex commercial"**. Everything else
      was BSD-3 (torch, scikit-learn, flask), Apache-2.0
      (sentence-transformers), or MIT (anthropic, duckdb, sqlite-vec).
      Enterprise scanners commonly ban AGPL outright, and Curious Astronaut is a Flask
      **network service** — precisely the scenario AGPL §13 targets.

      It shipped as one of the three extras in the packaging split (see
      **"The heavy capabilities became optional extras"** under *Reach &
      access* for the size story and the enforced no-module-scope-import
      invariant). `pip install <dist>` now has no AGPL anywhere in its
      dependency graph; `pip install <dist>[pdf]` keeps today's behavior, and
      an install without it degrades by name through `optional.require`
      rather than crashing on `No module named 'fitz'`. **One published
      package, no divergent branch** whose pymupdf-removal could drift back
      into `main` — which was Patrick's stated worry, 2026-08-09.

      It was contained enough to be tractable: pymupdf is imported in exactly
      three modules — `services/pdf/{floats,mine,text}.py` — with references
      in `config.py` and `services/sources/extract.py`.

      **What this does *not* settle** is whether it clears the work-side Xray
      gate: some policy engines flag *declared* optional dependencies, not
      just resolved ones. That question rides with the still-open "Publish to
      PyPI" ticket, along with the fallback if the answer is bad (swapping to
      `pypdfium2` or `pdfminer.six`, a much bigger job since `mine.py` and
      `floats.py` lean on PyMuPDF's layout and image extraction). Shipping the
      extra was worth doing on its own merits regardless: it lightens the
      default install and removes a copyleft dependency from a network
      service. *(Filed 2026-08-09 out of the PyPI packaging discussion;
      shipped 2026-08-28.)*

- [x] **`refs` → `graph_refs`: naming the citation maps apart** *(v6.12.0)* —
      three different `[n]`-marker maps had grown up beside each other, and the
      oldest and most load-bearing was the one with the least specific name:
      `refs` (marker → graph node id) sat next to `sourceRefs` (→ a library
      passage) and `paperRefs` (→ a paper with no graph to point at). v6.11.0
      made the collision matter — it put two kinds of citation chip in one
      transcript — so Patrick called the rename immediately after.

      Renamed on both sides of the wire, keeping each side's convention:
      `Beat.refs` → `Beat.graph_refs` (snake_case, backend-resolved, because a
      lecture's numbered list is the mode-filtered `_story_nodes` the frontend
      never sees), `prompts.refs_from_text` → `graph_refs_from_text`, and
      frontend-side `msg.refs` → `msg.graphRefs` with `refsSet` /
      `resolveRefs` following. Deliberately **not** renamed: `SourceRefs.refs`
      and `PaperRefs.refs`, which are those events' own envelope field rather
      than the graph-ref concept — renaming them would have muddied the
      distinction the ticket existed to draw.

      **The part that needed care was the save format.** `refs` is persisted
      in saved sessions, on chat turns *and* on cached lecture beats, so a
      straight rename would have silently dropped the maps on every existing
      save — and silently is the operative word: the session restores looking
      perfectly fine, with every citation quietly reduced to inert text. A
      restore-time migration reads whichever key a save carries. That path had
      no coverage at all, so it got the frontend suite's first thunk-mocking
      test (legacy save migrates; current save passes through untouched).
      *(Requested 2026-08-13; shipped 2026-08-13.)*

- [x] **CI — run the quality gate on GitHub, and check tag/version at release
      time** *(v6.10.0)* — the first of the three stages in the "build / deploy /
      release strategy" ticket; the rest (repeatable build, publish, deploy)
      stays open. There was **no `.github/workflows/` at all**, so the gate
      depended entirely on remembering to run it — and it was skippable without
      leaving a trace, since a missing `trivy` makes nox's `security` session
      skip *silently* and still report success.
      **`ci.yml`** runs `bin/setup.sh` then `uv run nox` on `ubuntu-latest` and
      `windows-latest`, plus `npm run build`. Design decisions worth keeping:
      **(1)** the toolchain comes from **`jdx/mise-action`** reading
      `.tool-versions`, so CI installs the same pinned python/uv/node/trivy the
      dev machines do — one source of truth, and Trivy genuinely on PATH means
      the security scan *runs* instead of skipping, which was the original
      motivation. **(2)** It **reuses `bin/setup.sh`** rather than restating the
      bootstrap, so CI can't drift from local. **(3)** `npm run build` is a
      separate step because **no nox session typechecks the frontend** — `tsc -b`
      was a manual step in the working agreement, and CI closes that gap.
      **(4)** Windows runners use Git Bash, so one `.sh` serves both and
      `setup.bat` stays a local convenience.
      **The torch finding, which shaped the whole thing.** Nothing in the gate
      needs torch: `sentence_transformers` is imported lazily inside
      `services/sources/embeddings.py`'s `_load_model`, and `stub_embeddings`
      monkeypatches the three entry points. Verified by building a genuinely
      torch-free env — **605 tests passed, mypy clean over 93 source files**.
      *(That verification was true but not the whole story, as the first CI run
      then proved: some of those passes were the suite silently **abstaining**,
      because `_load_model` swallows a failed import and degrades to lexical
      search. See the bugs.md entry below.)* That matters because the lockfile
      carries ~15
      `nvidia-*` CUDA packages gated `sys_platform == 'linux'`, so a naive
      `uv sync` on `ubuntu-latest` downloads the full CUDA stack every cold
      cache (the env drops 951M → 484M on macOS, far more on Linux). Shipped as
      **`CA_SKIP_TORCH=1`**, an opt-in guard added to `bin/setup.{sh,bat}` so
      CI and a local bootstrap remain **one script**. It also makes
      `windows-latest` cheap, since the `[[tool.uv.index]]` CUDA routing never
      engages. **Deliberate side effect: CI now fails if anything imports torch
      at module scope**, which is what keeps the lazy import honest — the fix
      for such a failure is the eager import, never installing torch in CI.
      **`release.yml`** fires on `v*` tags and asserts the tag matches
      `pyproject.toml`'s version. The release ritual is four manual steps and
      nothing had ever checked that the bump and the tag agree — a `v6.9.0` tag
      on a tree still saying `6.8.0` was silent. It deliberately builds and
      publishes nothing; the distribution shape is blocked on the PyMuPDF/AGPL
      question, and the file is where that work will land.
      **Release model — no release branches.** Considered and rejected
      `release/<version>`: that's a **git-flow** artifact solving two problems
      this repo doesn't have (freezing an RC while `develop` takes features, and
      maintaining parallel lines). Solo, single-version, no RC period → pure
      overhead. Also rejected **release-please/semantic-release**: they expect
      Conventional Commits and a generated `CHANGELOG.md`, and would fight the
      hand-written narrative in this very file. Settled on the standard
      **tag-triggered release from `main`**, which is what CLAUDE.md already
      described by hand. Revisit release branches only if a `release/6.x`
      backport line ever becomes real.
      **Verified before merge** by temporarily adding `feature/ci-workflow` to
      the push trigger and watching a real run (a workflow can only be exercised
      from a branch it triggers on, and push/dispatch both need the default
      branch) — the temporary trigger was stripped before the merge. **It paid
      for itself on run #1**, which was green on Linux and crashed the
      interpreter on Windows, surfacing two defects that had been invisible
      locally: `uv run` re-syncing away the torch exclusion (fixed with
      `--no-sync`), and a genuine test-isolation leak where the suite loaded a
      real BERT model whenever torch happened to be importable. Both are
      written up in [bugs.md](bugs.md) — the second is the more valuable find,
      and it argues on its own for keeping the Windows runner.
      **Also corrected here:** `CLAUDE.md` had claimed the repo was **private**
      since before the pivot; the GitHub API says public (MIT, created
      2026-06-28). Two things follow that had been mis-reasoned all session —
      Actions minutes are **free and unlimited** on public repos' standard
      runners, and the "public, timestamped release" prior-art defense in
      `docs/licensing.md` is **already satisfied by the repo itself**, not
      pending a PyPI release.

- [x] **Sweep single-letter identifiers out of the frontend, then machine-enforce
      it** *(v6.9.0)* — the no-single-letter-identifiers convention covers *both*
      halves of the codebase, but only the backend was enforced:
      `bin/check_identifiers.py` reads `.py` and `.ipynb`, so the frontend had
      drifted unnoticed since the one-time v2.4.2 sweep. **72 raw violations
      across 15 files** as of 2026-08-06, worst in
      `test/graph/clusterForce.test.ts` (13), `src/notation/latexToUnicode.ts`
      (9), and `src/api/agents.ts` (9 — the SSE handler params `h`/`t`/`d`/`f`,
      spotted while adding `onSourceRefs` there for structured citations).
      **The enforcement half was cheap, as scouted: oxlint *does* implement
      `id-length`** (as `eslint(id-length)`) — CLAUDE.md's "no min-name-length
      rule" note is about **ruff**, not oxlint, so the frontend never needed the
      custom-hook treatment the backend got.
      **Where the shipped design diverged from the ticket.** The plan was an
      `exceptions: ["a", "x", "y"]` list, since a real share of the 72 are
      exemptions CLAUDE.md already grants (react-force-graph's `node.x`/`.y`,
      the `_s`/`_t` endpoint fields, `AnswerMarkdown.tsx`'s `a:` react-markdown
      override for the `<a>` *tag*, `latexToUnicode`'s map keyed by the LaTeX
      character itself). But a global exceptions list whitelists those letters
      as **variable** names too, which is exactly what the rule exists to stop.
      Shipped instead: **`properties: "never"`** — property access and
      object-literal keys are out of scope, mirroring the backend hook's own
      "attribute reads are out of scope" rule — with `exceptions` holding only
      `_`, the pure-discard idiom. That cut 72 raw hits to **20 genuine ones**
      without whitelisting a single letter as a name. Trade-off, documented in
      `frontend/src/README.md`: a destructured `const { a } = obj` slips
      through; tightening it would flag ~50 legitimate external names.
      **The sweep.** `handlers` not `h` and `trace`/`discovery`/`figure` not
      `t`/`d`/`f` (`api/agents.ts`, JSDoc realigned); `query` not `q`
      (`api/search.ts`, `header/AtlasHeader.tsx`); `event` not `e`;
      `size: { width, height }` not `{ w, h }` (`useTimeline` + its two callers
      and test); `simX`/`simY` in the marquee test helpers. `GraphCanvas`'s two
      inline `VNode & { x: number; y: number }` narrowings became one named
      **`PositionedVNode`** = `Required<Pick<VNode, 'x' | 'y'>>` in `model.ts` —
      better than a disable comment, since the single letters appear only as
      string-literal type keys. The two external field names still *declared* in
      our own types — `VNode`'s `x`/`y`, `LiveSearchResponse.q` (the `?q=` wire
      key the backend echoes; renaming it would mean touching routes + backend
      tests, out of scope for a frontend sweep) — carry a scoped
      `oxlint-disable id-length` plus a comment naming whose field it is,
      because TS property *signatures* are declarations and stay in scope.
      **`test/` is in scope** (Patrick, 2026-08-06) — over half the hits lived
      there and the tests mirror `src/`; the existing `test/**` override block
      relaxes only the jsdoc rules, and `id-length` was deliberately *not*
      added to it. The rule rides the existing `precommit` nox session for
      free. Behavior-neutral: all five nox sessions green (491 backend tests,
      214 frontend tests, strict mypy, Trivy), verified in the browser.
      **Found along the way:** the pre-commit `prettier`/`oxlint` hooks' trigger
      pattern never matched `frontend/test/` — see [bugs.md](bugs.md).
      *(Filed 2026-08-06 out of the structured-source-citations branch; shipped
      2026-08-09.)*
- [x] **Budget vocabulary — name the two rules, define every term once**
      *(v5.10.0)* — the landmark-sizing code had accumulated a vocabulary nobody
      could read: five functions whose names described a *criterion* ("density")
      rather than a *mechanic*, a label written `n*` that most prose quietly
      confused with the rule the app actually serves, and the word **"anchor"**
      meaning three unrelated things (the four worked-example papers; where the
      model's age feature is measured from; force-graph node pinning on the
      frontend). Patrick's diagnosis: *"it's just too confusing to follow without
      precise examples."*
      **The distinction everything turns on**, now carried by the names: both
      rules bucket a seed's citation-ranked citers by publication year and cap
      every bucket at 12; they differ in **one word** — on a full bucket, one
      **STOPS** the walk (`number_of_ranked_citers_before_a_single_year_overflows`,
      the model's training label, and *only* that — no serving path calls it),
      the other **SKIPS** that citer and keeps walking
      (`select_up_to_cap_per_year`, what the live S2 fallback ships). Also
      `density_selection`→`select_landmarks`, `model_budget`→`predicted_budget`,
      `DENSITY_CAP`→`PER_YEAR_CAP`, `is_anchor`→`is_worked_example`, and
      "re-anchoring"→choosing the **age origin**. Config keys deliberately
      untouched (`config.json` is gitignored — renaming them would mean a hand
      migration on every machine).
      **[docs/landmark-vocabulary.md](landmark-vocabulary.md) is new and
      canonical** — every term with a worked example, the three senses of
      "anchor" named apart, and an old→new table so this file's older entries
      stay readable (they keep the pre-v5.10.0 names on purpose: they are
      records of what shipped then). Everything else links there instead of
      restating, per the repo's one-definition rule. Every toy example in it was
      executed against the real functions rather than asserted.
      **Data contracts moved too** (CSV headers; the artifact's `density_cap` key
      → `per_year_cap`) — safe because retraining `cite_budget` from the
      committed corpus reproduced `cv_r2 = 0.6804741428173474` to all sixteen
      digits with identical coefficients, proving a header rewrite is equivalent
      to re-collecting, so no live API traffic was needed. `latest_gap`
      reproduced `tau=0.25`/`max_span=7` likewise and its artifact was left
      untouched.
      **Six bugs surfaced on the way**, the notable one written up in
      [bugs.md](bugs.md): two of the three research notebooks had been
      **un-executable since the src-layout migration** and nobody knew, because
      nothing in the gate runs a notebook; `research/latest_gap/README.md`
      documented the **rejected** quantile design (`q=0.85, max_span=9`) as if it
      were shipped, contradicting its own notebook *and* `bands.py`; and two test
      docstrings claimed the STOP rule was the live fallback's trim — backwards
      since v5.5.0, i.e. the exact confusion this whole change set out to kill,
      sitting in the tests.
- [x] **Phase 2.3 — Legacy teardown** *(v1.4.0)* — retired the digest-era backend
      now that Curious Astronaut stands on its own: deleted `store.py`, `pipeline.py`,
      `summarizer.py`, `embeddings.py`; slimmed `search.py`/`arxiv_client.py` to
      just the seed search; removed 8 legacy `app.py` routes + 8 unused `api.ts`
      functions; trimmed dead `config.py`/`.env.example` settings; `run.py` is now
      `serve`-only. `taxonomy.py` kept **dormant** for near-term features. (See
      "Deliberately dropped" below for the what/why.)
- [x] **Frontend/backend package refactor** *(v1.15.1–v1.15.2)* — the whole
      codebase reorganized into concern packages. Backend: `app.py` → a thin
      factory over `routes/` blueprints; `teacher.py` (1,280 lines) → a
      `teacher/` package (backends, lecture, qa, agentic, tools, sources_chat);
      then (v1.15.2) the remaining flat modules grouped into role packages —
      `integrations/` (S2, arXiv, ar5iv), `services/` (graph, search),
      `storage/` (cache, sessions), `library/` (sources, embeddings) — with
      **Google-style docstrings (Args/Returns/Raises) on all 134 backend
      functions**. Frontend: `api.ts` → an `api/` module; `GraphExplorer.tsx`
      (1,244 lines) → `App.tsx` (a 560-line orchestrator) over concern
      folders — `header/`, `search/`, `graph/`, `detail/`, `teacher/`,
      `library/`, `sessions/` — each owning its components, hooks, and CSS
      (the 1,000-line `curious_astronaut.css` split alongside). Everything
      JSDoc/docstring-documented.
- [x] **`src/` layout for the backend** *(v1.21.2)* — `backend/arxiv_digest/` →
      `src/arxiv_digest/` (the standard `src`-layout), with the project now a real
      **installed package** (hatchling build, uv editable install): `backend/run.py`
      folded into the package as `cli.py` behind an **`arxiv-atlas` console script**
      (`uv run arxiv-astronaut serve` replaces `uv run python backend/run.py serve`;
      same subcommands), and every `sys.path` shim deleted — imports just work in
      tests, nox, and one-liners. mypy/pytest configs retargeted. The move also
      let mypy see `cli.py` for the first time, catching a **real bug**: CLI
      `search-sources` still passed the pre-v1.19 `source_id=` kwarg (a runtime
      TypeError since the multi-select rename) and printed the pre-v1.21
      `distance` field — both fixed. Paves the way for `test/` to mirror
      `src/arxiv_digest/` in the coverage push. *(From the `todos.md` inbox,
      2026-07-03.)*
- [x] **`noxfile` + CI quality backbone** *(2026-07-03)* — **`uv run nox`** runs
      four sessions from `noxfile.py` (all reusing the uv env): **`precommit`**
      (pre-commit hooks + **ruff** lint), **`mypy`** (types), **`tests`**
      (**pytest** over a new `test/`, offline smoke tests), and **`security`** (a
      **Trivy** fs scan that skips cleanly when trivy isn't on PATH, so the gate
      stays green without it). Config lives in `pyproject.toml`; `CLAUDE.md`
      documents the gate. mypy runs on a **lenient baseline** (see next item).
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-03.)*
- [x] **Burn down the mypy baseline** *(v1.21.1)* — all four silenced error codes
      (`union-attr`, `return-value`, `arg-type`, `call-overload`; 141 hidden
      findings) fixed and `disable_error_code` **deleted**, plus
      `check_untyped_defs = true` turned on (so untyped function bodies are checked
      too — stricter than the original goal). The big one: `teacher/agentic.py`'s
      116 union-attr errors fell to **isinstance narrowing on the SDK's real event
      types** (`RawContentBlockStartEvent` / `RawContentBlockDeltaEvent` /
      `TextDelta` / `ToolUseBlock`) replacing `getattr(…, "type", "")` duck-typing;
      Flask views returning `(body, status)` tuples now use
      `flask.typing.ResponseReturnValue`; `_TOOLS` typed as `list[ToolParam]` via
      `TYPE_CHECKING`; the SSE generators annotated with runtime-enforcing
      `assert isinstance` narrowing on the `(kind, data)` event protocol. Verified
      behavior-neutral by driving `answer_agentic` with a stubbed client emitting
      real SDK event objects (discard, split-sentinel hiding, cited parsing).
- [x] **Expand test coverage (a lot)** *(v1.21.3)* — the suite went from 7 smoke
      tests to **105 offline tests**, in a `test/` tree that **mirrors
      `src/arxiv_digest/`**. Five layers: the **agentic loop** (driven by a
      scripted `FakeClaude` emitting *real* SDK event objects — discard,
      split-sentinel hiding, budgets, wallclock), the **tool runners** (budgets,
      visited-sets, edge directions, scope override), the **S2 client + graph
      service** (node normalization, 429 backoff, batch chunking, cache = zero
      repeat calls), the **routes** (error mapping, SSE framing, sessions CRUD,
      SSRF lock), and the **library** (chunker semantics, real in-memory PDFs via
      pymupdf incl. scanned rejection, scope semantics, delete cascade). Shared
      `conftest.py` fixtures isolate every test onto temp DBs (the real `data/`
      is untouchable) and stub embeddings deterministically (no torch load). The
      route tests **found and fixed a real bug**: all three SSE generators in
      `routes/teacher.py` logged via `current_app` during response iteration
      (outside the request context), so a mid-stream failure raised RuntimeError
      and killed the stream before the `error` event reached the panel — now a
      module logger, with the `token → error` framing locked in by a test.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-04.)*
- [x] **File logging + honest search-failure traces** *(v2.1.0)* — `create_app()`
      now logs to a rotating file (`data/curious-astronaut.log`, 5MB × 3 backups) as well as
      the console, so agent runs survive after the terminal scrolls away.
      Diagnosing a real failure (a `search_papers` call for "BERT pre-training
      deep bidirectional transformers...") turned up two gaps: the researcher's
      `search_papers`/`expand_node` tools caught `S2Error` but never logged it
      (unlike `show_figure`/`search_sources`), and the "Tried" trace chip looked
      identical whether a search failed on an S2 error, an empty query, the
      overall step budget, or — the actual cause here — the search-specific
      budget (`BUDGETS["searches"] = 3`) already being spent by earlier calls
      in the same turn. Fixed both: added the missing `log.warning` calls, and
      gave `SearchTrace` a `reason` field (`empty_query` / `steps_exhausted` /
      `budget_exhausted` / `error`) that the chat UI now renders as a specific
      annotation instead of a bare "Tried" (older saved sessions without the
      field still fall back to the old generic wording).
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-06.)*
      **Next:** sweep other silent-failure spots (other agent tools, route
      error paths) that should log before returning a user-facing message.
- [x] **No single-letter identifiers** *(v2.4.2)* — swept the whole codebase
      (backend `src/curious_astronaut`, `frontend/src`, **and** `test/`) clean of
      single-letter variable / parameter / loop / comprehension / generic-type
      names, renaming each for what it holds: `node` not `n`, `event` not `e`,
      `query` not `q`, `top_k` not `k` (threaded through the public
      `sources.search(...)` kwarg and its callers/tests), `Item` not `T`,
      `(prev) =>` in setState updaters, `catch (error)`. Left the genuinely
      non-single-letter shorthands already in the code (`ctx`, `fg`, `lo`/`hi`,
      `err`, `msg`, `buf`, `frac`) and external property names we don't own
      (react-force-graph's `node.x`/`.y`, the `_s`/`_t` endpoint fields, the
      `"q"` API keys). Made it a **standing convention** in `CLAUDE.md`
      ("Code conventions") so it doesn't drift back. Behavior-neutral: the whole
      quality gate (ruff, strict mypy, 277 tests, tsc + oxlint) stays green.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-06.)*
- [x] **CLI → `click`** *(v1.11.0)* — replaced the hand-rolled `argparse` in
      `run.py` with a `click` group (same command names: `serve`, `ingest`,
      `sources`, `search-sources`, `forget`).
- [x] **Session bootstrap scripts + pinned toolchain via mise** *(2026-07-09,
      no version bump — dev tooling, not the app)* — a session that opened on a
      stale env used to fail confusingly (v3.8.0's markdown deps missing from
      `node_modules` broke the frontend build; trivy absent meant nox silently
      skipped the security scan). Now `.tool-versions` pins the toolchain
      (python 3.14.0, uv 0.11.25, nodejs 24.18.0, trivy 0.72.0) and
      **`bin/setup.bat`** (Windows) / **`bin/setup.sh`** (macOS/Linux) — the
      mandated first step of every Claude session, per `CLAUDE.md` — runs
      `mise install` + `reshim`, `uv sync`, and `npm install` + `npm run build`
      for the frontend. **mise** was chosen over asdf deliberately: asdf has no
      Windows support at all (Patrick's primary machine), while mise runs on
      Windows *and* macOS and reads the same asdf-format `.tool-versions`, so
      the pin file stays portable either way.
- [x] **Config reorg: data APIs grouped under `providers`** *(v4.3.0)* — the
      top-level `s2` and `openalex` config groups moved into one
      **`providers`** object (`config.providers.s2.*`,
      `config.providers.openalex.*`), mirroring how `llm.providers` groups
      the LLM vendors — connection settings (keys, URLs, timeouts,
      throttles) now live together per external data API, and adding a
      future source is a field, not a redesign. The LLM vendor model was
      renamed `ProvidersConfig` → `LLMProvidersConfig` so the two
      "providers" concepts can't collide in code. Mechanical rename across
      ~10 consumer modules + tests + docs (`docs/configuration.md` gained a
      `providers` section with an OpenAlex subsection). **Breaking for
      `config.json`** (it's gitignored and single-user, so shipped as a
      minor by agreement): move your `s2`/`openalex` blocks under
      `"providers": { ... }` — values unchanged.
- [x] **Frontend package nesting + full README coverage** *(v4.3.1 — prep
      for the "Frontend quality" backlog)* — `GraphCanvas` and
      `GraphControls` moved into nested sub-packages **`graph/canvas/`**
      and **`graph/controls/`** (Legend joined `controls/` — same
      single-parent DOM-chrome layer), each with its own README;
      `graph/README.md` refactored down to the package overview + the
      cross-cutting RFG identity contract, with the component/hook
      deep-dives relocated into `canvas/`, `controls/`, and `hooks/`
      READMEs. A full-frontend sweep against the hybrid structure rule
      found no other nesting warranted but four folders missing READMEs —
      `graph/hooks/`, `teacher/figures/`, `teacher/transcript/`, `ui/` —
      all written, so `src/README.md`'s "every folder has its own README"
      claim is now true. Zero behavior change (the production bundle hash
      is byte-identical). **New standing convention in `CLAUDE.md`**: every
      new package ships with a README; code changes refactor the affected
      READMEs in the same change. *(Patrick's ask, 2026-07-09.)*
- [x] **Frontend pre-commit (format + lint)** *(2026-07-09, no version
      bump — dev tooling, not the app)* — **prettier** (3.8.4, pinned exact)
      added as the formatter, configured to the existing house style
      (`semi: false`, single quotes, printWidth 100) so the one-time sweep
      stayed small (23 files, +166/−159, render-equivalent JSX whitespace
      reflows only); scoped to `src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}` + `test/` +
      `vite.config.ts` — deliberately not the hand-formatted READMEs or the
      JSONC tsconfigs.
      Two **local pre-commit hooks** (prettier then oxlint, both running the
      frontend's own npm scripts) join the existing gate, so
      `uv run nox -s precommit` now enforces frontend hygiene the same way
      it does backend hygiene — prettier fixes in place like ruff `--fix`
      (verified with a negative test: a deliberately mangled file failed the
      run and came back formatted). New npm scripts `format` /
      `format:check`. *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-07.)*
- [x] **Frontend tests — Vitest + React Testing Library** *(v4.4.0;
      completes the "Frontend quality" backlog section, promoted here)* —
      the frontend now has a real offline test surface: **Vitest 4** (+
      jsdom + RTL), configured in `vite.config.ts`'s `test` block, with the
      suite in **`frontend/test/`** mirroring `src/` the way the backend's
      `test/` mirrors `src/curious_astronaut/`. Seven files / **54 tests** cover the
      pure logic with real edge cases — `graph/model` helpers (incl. the
      `ID_RE` pasted-id fast path), `notation/splitMath` (math vs. currency
      vs. mid-stream unclosed delimiters) and `latexToUnicode`, the
      `<<FIG n>>` interleaver (streaming-tail holdback, invented slots,
      leftovers), `remarkCite` on hand-built mdast — plus a jsdom/RTL pair
      (`Legend`'s conditional agent entries, `useResizablePanel`'s
      seed/clamp/drag/persist). Node environment by default, per-file
      `@vitest-environment jsdom` opt-in, no test globals (everything
      imported from `vitest` explicitly). A new **`vitest` nox session**
      joins the default gate — `uv run nox` is now the whole-repo gate
      (backend 328 + frontend 54; skips cleanly without npm, the Trivy
      pattern) — and prettier's scope covers `test/`. Next natural target
      (per `frontend/test/README.md`): `useConversation` driven by scripted
      SSE events, the `fake_claude` idea client-side. *(From the `todos.md`
      inbox, 2026-07-07.)*
- [x] **No-single-letter-identifiers rule, machine-enforced** *(v5.3.0)* —
      the v2.4.2 naming convention (every binding named for what it holds)
      had only `CLAUDE.md` keeping it true; now a **local pre-commit hook**
      enforces it. Ruff has no minimum-identifier-length rule (E741 only
      bans the ambiguous `l`/`I`/`O`), so **`bin/check_identifiers.py`**
      walks the AST itself and flags every single-character *binding* —
      assignments (incl. walrus), loop/comprehension targets, parameters,
      function/class names, `except`/`with`/import aliases,
      `global`/`nonlocal`, `match` captures, PEP 695 type params — with `_`
      allowed as the pure-discard idiom and attribute *reads* out of scope
      (react-force-graph's `node.x`, a paper's `_s` field aren't bindings we
      own). **Notebooks are covered too**: each `.ipynb` code cell is parsed
      individually and reported ruff-style (`file:cell N:line`; cells that
      aren't plain Python, e.g. magics, are skipped). The sweep that made it
      green caught stragglers in four test files and three research
      notebooks (`k`/`v` → `key`/`values`, `i` → `index`, `lambda *a, **kw`
      → `*args, **kwargs`) — including one in the days-old v5.1
      `test_search.py`, exactly the drift the hook exists to stop.
      Negative-tested: a deliberately bad file fails the run. *(Follow-through
      on the v2.4.2 sweep.)*
- [x] **`astronaut serve` takes `--port` and `--host`** *(v4.10.0)* — the CLI serve
      command gained `--host`/`--port` options that override
      `config.server.host`/`port` per invocation (a second instance, or when 5000
      is busy, no longer needs a config edit). Both default to `None` and fall
      back to config, so existing behavior is unchanged; `app.main(host, port)`
      applies the fallback. Verified live (`serve --port 5055` binds there, 5000
      untouched). *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-11.)*
- [x] **Enforce docstrings in the gate, both languages** *(2026-07-10, no
      version bump — quality tooling; the whole sweep is runtime-invisible,
      bundle hash unchanged)* —
      - **Backend:** ruff's pydocstyle **`D` rules on (Google convention)**
        — a missing module/class/function docstring now fails the gate
        (D205 deliberately ignored: the house style opens with flowing
        multi-sentence paragraphs). **pydoclint** evaluated and adopted for
        *completeness*: Args must match the signature, Returns must exist
        where a value comes back (new pre-commit hook + `[tool.pydoclint]`;
        type-matching and raises-checks off — types live in annotations,
        and the house style rightly documents *propagated* exceptions,
        which pydoclint's lexical raises-check would outlaw). Sweep fixed
        ~45 gaps: 20 auto-fixed quote placements, 7 undocumented params
        (incl. every researcher tool's `ctx` and ingest's `on_progress` —
        the exact complaint), 5 tool Returns sections, missing
        `__init__`/method docstrings, `_figure_pool`/`resolvable_id` Args.
      - **Frontend:** oxlint's **jsdoc plugin on** (`require-param` with
        `checkDestructured: false` — component props stay documented on
        their Props interfaces, not duplicated as tags — `require-returns`,
        description/name/tag rules; off for `test/**`, mirroring the
        backend's per-file-ignores). Fixed all 96 completeness findings and
        swept JSDoc onto the 17 still-undocumented functions (components,
        selectors, reducers, hooks), so every function is documented with
        backend-style structure. **Caveat:** oxlint has no `require-jsdoc`,
        so *presence* on brand-new functions stays a convention (CLAUDE.md);
        completeness of anything documented is machine-enforced.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-09.)*
- [x] **Moved `ml_pipelines/` into `src/` and split `models/` per model**
      *(v4.10.1)* — the training pipelines moved from the repo root to
      `src/ml_pipelines/` — a second top-level package **alongside** `src/curious_astronaut/`,
      **not** bundled into the shipped app wheel (`packages = ["src/curious_astronaut"]`
      unchanged) and not force-typed by strict mypy, but importable everywhere
      because the editable install already puts `src/` on `sys.path`. The shared
      `ml_pipelines/models/` package **dissolved**: each model's committed
      artifact now lives **beside its own code** as `model.joblib` +
      `model.metadata.json` inside `cite_budget/` and `latest_gap/`, so a model's
      collector, trainer, corpus, README, and artifact sit together. The app's
      load paths (`services/graph/budget.py`, `bands.py`) and the trainers' write
      paths point at the new per-package location; `pyproject`'s `pythonpath`
      dropped the repo-root `"."` (everything's under `src/` now). The `models/`
      README was deleted, its "committed / regenerated-not-edited / loaded-
      defensively / version-skew" notes folded into each package README. Verified
      the app loads both models from the new paths and the full gate is green.
      *(From the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-10.)*
- [x] **Delete the four dead per-relation count caps — the app should size itself**
      *(v6.0.0)* — `ref_limit`, `cite_limit`, `latest_limit` and `similar_limit`
      were all **`null` in the real `config.json`** and had been for a long time:
      the app already sizes every relation itself (the fitted `PER_YEAR_CAP` of
      12 per publication year, `bands`' fitted `tau`/`max_span`, and
      `UNBOUNDED_LANDMARK_CAP` as the payload ceiling) — knobs nobody turns.
      Patrick's call (2026-07-17): sizing should be **automatic**, with a
      user-facing "show me more" setting later if wanted — not a config file
      nobody edits. Unblocked by v5.11.0 making the two sizings agree on what an
      unset `cite_limit` meant (`predicted_budget` read it as
      `UNBOUNDED_LANDMARK_CAP`, `select_landmarks` as infinity — a field two
      code paths interpret differently can't be deleted).
      **Shipped as the v6.0.0 config purge — scope grown mid-flight (Patrick,
      2026-07-19):** the four caps went, and with them their whole plumbing (the
      `landmark_limit`/`latest_limit` traversal params and every ceiling read in
      `budget.py`/`build.py`); `adaptive_cite_limit` and `adaptive_latest_band`
      went too — sizing is **purely adaptive** now, the toggles were
      off-switches nobody flipped (the settings modal's coming `adaptive`
      checkbox re-introduces the choice as a *user-facing, per-request* concern,
      not a config field), which also collapsed `bands.band_start_rule` into the
      one config-free `earliest_band_year`; and `recs_pool` became a
      **parameter** on `s2.recommendations` (module-constant `"all-cs"`
      default). `UNBOUNDED_LANDMARK_CAP` moved to a new shared
      `integrations/caps.py`, **named as the payload guard it is** (never
      fitted, deliberately not config — the "worth deciding while in there"
      item), where both providers use it without depending on each other. The
      band-shape knobs left config too (Patrick's symmetry argument: if
      landmark sizing isn't configurable, band sizing isn't either), renamed
      on the way out: `caps.LATEST_NUMBER_OF_BANDS` and
      `caps.LATEST_NODES_PER_BAND` (were `latest_band_years`/`latest_per_year`,
      briefly `graph.latest_nodes.*`) — `caps.py` grew from the payload guard
      into the shared cross-provider sizing-constants module. **Migration:**
      `extra="forbid"` fails startup until each machine's gitignored
      `config.json` drops to the two-key `graph` shape, and `CLAUDE.md`'s
      session-start drift check now flags keys the template has *dropped*, not
      just added. Two placement fixes rode along: `default_provider` moved from
      `graph` to `providers` (it lives beside the services it chooses between),
      and the corpus's two storage roots (`storage.s2.{raw,parquet}` — the
      slow-drive/fast-drive split) recombined into one `storage.s2_corpus`
      (one drive held both in practice; the per-release `raw/`+`parquet/`
      subtrees were already shaped for it, so same-directory setups migrate
      with a config edit alone). `GraphConfig` ends at `cache_ttl` alone —
      config.json is operator concerns only, and `docs/constants.md` (new)
      catalogues every code-side constant the purge decisions rest on.
      *(Patrick, 2026-07-17; browser-tested.)*
- [x] **~~Iterative (multi-round) landmark mining to beat recency bias~~ —
      RETIRED** *(v4.0.0)* — this was an idea to loop S2 reference-list mining to
      fill the sparse early-landmark band. The **OpenAlex hybrid** (shipped)
      recovers that band directly with a sorted `cites:` query — no mining, no
      verification, no loop — and the whole S2 mining apparatus it built on was
      deleted. Kept only as a tombstone; the live fallback path is plain deep
      paging.
- [x] **Tie `docs/citation-coverage.md` to its research notebook** — the
      citation-coverage write-up (`docs/citation-coverage.md`) and the experiment
      that backs it (`research/citation_coverage/analyze.ipynb` + its README) live
      apart and can drift. Cross-link them: the doc should point at the notebook as
      the source of its numbers/plots, and the notebook/README should point back at
      the doc — the same doc↔notebook pairing `cite_budget` and `latest_gap`
      already have (each `analyze.ipynb` is referenced from its ship note). *(From
      the `todos.md` inbox, 2026-07-13.)*

## Deliberately dropped in v1.0

The digest era's local-first machinery is retired in favor of dynamic queries.
The **code** for all of this was removed in the **v1.4.0 legacy teardown** (only
`taxonomy.py` survives, dormant):

- Local **paper corpus** (`papers` table) + the `store.py` module — no more
  storing paper rows.
- **FTS5** full-text index (`papers_fts`) and **sqlite-vec** vector index
  (`papers_vec`), plus `embeddings.py` and the hybrid `search.py` — search /
  similarity now come from Semantic Scholar.
- The **`pulls` ledger**, category-aware smart-pull, and `pipeline.py` — no
  date-range fetching.
- The **date-range digest table**, pagination, the **Download modal**, and the
  **NotebookLM export** — plus `summarizer.py` (its dual-backend Claude pattern
  lives on in `teacher.py`).

*(Resolved: we committed fully to the graph-first experience — no daily-digest
mode.)*

## Legacy — the v0.x.x "digest" era (kept for history)

The app began as a local-first daily digest: pull arXiv papers by category into
SQLite, summarize with Claude, browse in a paginated table with hybrid search,
export to NotebookLM. Milestones:

| Version | What shipped |
|---|---|
| v0.9.0 | Search-aware NotebookLM export (export honors the active search query) |
| v0.9.1 | Category-aware smart pull — per-day/category `pulls` ledger so adding a subject re-fetches days already holding other categories |
| v0.9.2 | Category modal: taxonomy tooltips + "Clear all" |
| v0.10.0 | Live **"Search all of arXiv"** + on-the-fly per-paper **Add** |
| v0.11.0 | Separated **downloading from browsing** — unified Download modal; top-bar View range only filters |

**Enduring tech carried forward into v1.0:**
- **Dual-backend Claude summaries** — Claude CLI (Pro/Max subscription, no API
  billing) or the Anthropic API, with automatic fallback. Reused for narration.
- **arXiv taxonomy** picker/seed data.
- **arXiv search** entry point (title-phrase-boosted; id/URL detection).

**Retired with the pivot:** Gmail/OAuth ingestion (removed even earlier, in the
switch to the `arxiv` package), local hybrid search (FTS5 + sqlite-vec + RRF),
the digest table, and the smart-pull ledger.
