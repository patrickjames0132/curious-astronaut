# Configuration reference

`config.json` (repo root, gitignored) holds every tunable; copy
`config.example.json` to start. (Code-side constants — the tunables that
deliberately *aren't* config — are catalogued in
[`constants.md`](constants.md).) Each field's meaning lives as a Pydantic
`Field(description=...)` right next to it in
[`config.py`](../src/curious_astronaut/config.py) — read that file for what each
setting does. This page is for the **why** behind specific example values,
where a JSON file (no comments allowed) can't say it.

## `providers` — external data APIs

The academic-data backbones the graph is built from, one sub-object per
service (`providers.s2`, `providers.openalex`) — grouped the same way
`llm.providers` groups the LLM vendors (which live separately under `llm`,
because those are chat/tool-use credentials, not graph data sources).

- **`default_provider: "s2"`** — which backend builds a graph when the request
  doesn't name one; the initial state of the header's provider dropdown, which
  overrides it per graph. Lives here beside the services it chooses between
  (moved out of `graph` 2026-07-19). See `config.py` for the s2-vs-openalex
  trade-off.

### `providers.s2` — Semantic Scholar

- **`min_interval: 1.1`** — even an authenticated API key only allows ~1
  request/second on the graph endpoints. Waiting 1.1s between requests up
  front is cheaper than firing bursts and eating 429s + exponential backoff.
  Set to `0` to disable (the test suite does this so it never sleeps).
- **No `api_key` still works.** Curious Astronaut runs fully keyless, just harder
  rate-limited. A free key from
  [semanticscholar.org/product/api](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api)
  lifts that ceiling substantially.

### `providers.openalex` — OpenAlex

- **`min_interval: 0.1`** — OpenAlex allows ~10 req/s, so a light throttle
  suffices; its budget/lock is separate from the S2 client's.
- **`mailto`** joins OpenAlex's "polite pool" (faster, more reliable) even
  keyless; a free `api_key` grants $1/day of metered usage vs $0.10 keyless
  (id/DOI lookups are free either way — see `config.py` for the pricing
  notes, verified live 2026-07-09).

## `storage.s2_corpus` — where the citations corpus lives

One root for everything: the downloaded `.gz` shards (~400 GB/release, deletable
once their ingest succeeds), the ingested Parquet working set (~50 GB), and the
`CURRENT` pointer, each release in its own subtree. Defaults to `null` (corpus
off — the s2 provider uses the live citation endpoint). Point it at a roomy
drive **outside the repo**:

```json
"s2_corpus": "E:\\s2corpus"
```

(History: this was two roots — `s2.raw` / `s2.parquet` — so the write-once
shards could sit on a slow big drive while the queried Parquet got the NVMe;
measured 20.6s vs 98.2s per shard, 2.2h vs 10.6h per release. Recombined
2026-07-19: in practice one drive held both, and the split was config surface
nobody used. If ingest speed ever matters again, the fix is a fast drive for
the whole root.) See
[`corpus/README.md`](../src/curious_astronaut/integrations/semantic_scholar/corpus/README.md).

## `graph` — neighborhood size

The app **sizes every relation itself** — there are no per-relation count
knobs. (The `ref_limit` / `cite_limit` / `latest_limit` / `similar_limit`
fields were deleted after sitting at `null` in the real `config.json` for
months; the only remaining ceiling is `UNBOUNDED_LANDMARK_CAP` (500) in
`src/curious_astronaut/integrations/caps.py` — a named **payload guard**, not a tuning
knob, so a mega seed can't page its entire citer list into one response.)

Sizing is **always adaptive** — no on/off toggles either (they were only ever
off-switches for the app's one sizing mechanism). The landmark band is sized
per seed by the STOP/SKIP rules in `services/graph/budget.py` (terms in
[`landmark-vocabulary.md`](landmark-vocabulary.md), history in
[`predict-vs-compute.md`](predict-vs-compute.md)), and the Latest bands start
at the **density tail edge** of the seed's landmark cluster (the fitted tau
rule in `services/graph/bands.py`, using the inlined `bands.TAU` / `bands.MAX_SPAN`).
The recommendations candidate pool is a call parameter now too
(`s2.recommendations(..., pool=)`, defaulting to `"all-cs"` in code — S2's
`"recent"` pool returns zero hits for seeds older than a year or two).

The Latest bands' shape lives in code too — `caps.LATEST_NUMBER_OF_BANDS`
(the fallback span, 5) and `caps.LATEST_NODES_PER_BAND` (top-N per band, 50)
— by the same argument as the landmarks: if landmark sizing isn't
configurable, band sizing isn't either. (The settings modal's non-adaptive
mode will hand this pair to the user *per request*, not through this file.)

What remains configurable:

- **`cache_ttl: 86400`** (1 day) — citation graphs change slowly; a day-long
  cache keeps repeat exploration and backtracking instant without
  re-hitting S2.

(The default provider lives with the providers it chooses between —
`providers.default_provider`, above — not here.)

## `ui` — what a fresh browser starts with

- **`default_theme: "dark"`** — the colour theme a browser with no saved
  preference opens in. The header's ☀/☾ toggle overrides it and remembers the
  choice locally, so this is the *default*, not a lock — the same shape of
  setting as `providers.default_provider`. Dark is the app's native look: the
  relation palette (gold seed, blue references, green landmarks, pink search)
  is tuned against it, and deliberately isn't re-themed in light mode, since
  those hues carry meaning and read on either background.

## `llm` — everything about talking to LLMs

Two things live under one group because an agent is meaningless without a
provider to run it on: **`llm.providers`** (backend vendor credentials) and
**`llm.agents`** (the agents themselves). Deliberately separate from
`sources.embedding` — that's a local embedding model for search, not a
chat/tool-use LLM.

### `llm.providers` — backend credentials

The agents run on [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev), which supports many
LLM vendors. PydanticAI itself separates *authentication* (a `Provider`
object, e.g. `AnthropicProvider(api_key=...)`) from *behavior* (an `Agent`:
system prompt, tools) — `llm.providers` mirrors that split so our config
maps cleanly onto PydanticAI's own constructs:

```json
"llm": {
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": { "api_key": "sk-ant-..." },
    "openai":    { "api_key": "",  "base_url": "" },
    "google":    { "api_key": "" },
    "ollama":    { "base_url": "" }
  }
}
```

**Four vendors are wired since v7.13.0**, and which one you use is a per-agent
choice (see `llm.agents` below), not a global switch.

**Every block must be present; the values may be blank.** A blank block means
*not configured*, and that is checked when an agent actually runs rather than
at startup — the graph explorer is keyless and has to keep working for someone
who has set up no LLM at all.

*That has only actually been true since v7.14.0.* Between v7.13.0 and then the
sentence above described the intent while the app still built every agent's
model at import, so a genuinely blank config crashed on startup instead of
serving the free half. Models are now built on first use, which also means
**changing an agent's vendor or model in Settings takes effect on the next
lecture, with no restart** — before, the modal saved the value and the running
agents kept the one they booted with.

Two of the four cost nothing, which is the point of having them:

| Vendor | Cost | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `anthropic` | paid | Billed per lecture and per question. |
| `openai` | paid | `base_url` blank = OpenAI itself, driven over its Responses API (the one that accepts function tools on its reasoning models). Set it and the same key/URL pair drives **any OpenAI-compatible server** — Groq, OpenRouter, Together, LM Studio — several with free tiers, over chat-completions, which is what those servers speak. An org with **no payment method** on file is capped at **10,000 TPM** (measured 2026-09-17: `Rate limit reached for gpt-6-… on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 10000`) — a single researcher request runs ~6.6k tokens and a turn makes several, so it trips on nearly every turn; either add a payment method or keep OpenAI for the lighter agents (summarizer, scouts). |
| `google` | **free tier** | A Google AI Studio key is free and quota-limited. The quota covers the **flash** models — `gemini-pro-latest` answers `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` on it (measured 2026-08-27), and a busy flash model can answer `503` transiently. A key on a paid project with spent credits 429s on everything, which looks identical and isn't. |
| `ollama` | **free, local** | No key, no signup, nothing leaves the machine. `base_url` is normally `http://localhost:11434/v1` — keep the `/v1`, that is where Ollama's OpenAI-compatible surface lives. |

One trade is worth knowing before choosing `ollama` for everything: a local
model has **no provider-side web search**, so the web scout goes quiet (it
returns empty and says so, rather than letting a search-less model invent
sources — see `agents/workers/search/web/`). Pointing just that one agent at a
cloud vendor is a supported and sensible mix.

Credentials live here, **not** on individual agents, because a
key belongs to an (account × vendor) pair, not to any one agent — two
agents sharing a vendor should share its key rather than duplicate it
(duplicated keys are a rotation hazard: change one copy and forget the
other). This also means we never rely on PydanticAI's own
environment-variable fallback for auth — every key is explicit, straight
from `config.json`.

### `llm.agents` — the agents this app runs

A **list** with one entry per sub-agent package under `src/curious_astronaut/agents/`,
potentially on different vendors. Today: `summarizer` (the detail panel's
on-demand paper TL;DR — generation only ever fires on the panel's explicit
TL;DR toggle, cached per paper forever), `lecturer`, `researcher`, and the two
workers it sends out, `paper_scout` and `web_scout`. Each entry:

```json
{ "id": "paper_scout", "model": "anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5",
  "extras": { "searches": 4, "search_limit": 8 } }
```

- **`id`** must be unique across the list — each agent package names the
  entry it builds from (its `config.py`'s `AGENT_ID`), so a duplicate would
  be ambiguous. Validated at load time.
- **`model`** is PydanticAI's own `"<provider>:<model_name>"` shorthand
  string (e.g. `"anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5"`), not a bare model name. The
  prefix must name a vendor configured under `llm.providers` — validated at
  load time, so a typo'd or unconfigured vendor fails immediately instead of
  on the agent's first request. The string is only ever **parsed** (by
  `agents/factory.py`, which constructs the provider explicitly with the
  config key) — never handed to PydanticAI whole, since the bare shorthand
  would fall back to environment variables for auth, against the rule
  above.
- An entry is deliberately **thin**: an agent's words (system prompt,
  skills) and its tool functions are *code*, defined in its own package's
  `config.py` and `tools.py` (see `src/curious_astronaut/agents/README.md`).
  Config carries only what an operator tunes — the model and the knobs.
- **`extras`** holds that agent's tuning knobs, and is **typed**: each
  agent id maps to a model in `config.py`'s `AGENT_EXTRAS` registry
  (`LecturerExtras`, `ResearcherExtras`, `LibrarianExtras`), so every knob
  has a bounded type, a default, and a description right beside it. Omit a
  knob and its default applies; write a nonsensical one (`min_beats: -1`,
  `max_steps: 0`) and the config fails to load. An agent with no registered
  knobs must leave `extras` empty.

  It began as a free-form `dict[str, Any]` staging area — a junk-drawer
  escape hatch for knobs with no permanent home — and each agent package
  range-checked its own values by hand at import. That left a real hole:
  anything the hand-checks didn't cover (a negative beat count) passed
  validation, which the settings modal made easy to hit. Typing them moved
  the rules to one place every writer of the config goes through — hand
  edit, modal save, or test. Adding a knob now means adding a field to the
  agent's extras model, not a bare key in this file.

## `server` — Flask + conversation policy

- **`history_turns: 8`** — each chat (graph Q&A and library chat, separate
  stores) keeps its last 8 user+assistant pairs as context, persisted only
  on success and trimmed after each turn. The whole retained window is
  re-sent to the model on *every* follow-up, so this is a token-cost and
  context-window cap, not a storage limit — 8 pairs keeps multi-step
  tutoring coherent while bounding the per-question overhead. Stores are
  in-memory (cleared on restart — fine for a local single-user app).

## `sources` — bring-your-own sources

Editable in **Settings ▸ Library** since v7.29.0 — the master switch on its
General sub-page, the rest on Embedding / Chunking / Retrieval — and a saved change applies live: the embedder is keyed on the
config that loaded it, so a new model or device loads on the next search
(the sources still need re-ingesting, see below), and the switch flipped off
and on reloads rather than staying "failed" until restart.

- **`embedding.model`**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim, symmetric (no query
  prefix needed). Swapping in an asymmetric model (e.g.
  `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`) needs a non-empty `query_prefix` *and*
  re-ingesting every existing source — their stored vectors were produced by
  the old model and aren't comparable to the new one's.
- **`embedding.device: "auto"`** — the torch device the embedder runs on.
  `auto` hands the choice to sentence-transformers, which already knows how to
  find cuda / mps / xpu and falls back to cpu; we don't second-guess it. Set an
  explicit device (`cpu`, `cuda`, `cuda:1`, `mps`) only to override — e.g. to
  keep the GPU free for something else. An explicit device that won't load
  falls back to cpu with a logged warning rather than taking search down.

  This only pays off with a **GPU-enabled torch build**. On Windows that isn't
  the default — PyPI ships a CPU-only wheel — so `pyproject.toml` routes torch
  to PyTorch's `cu130` index for `sys_platform == 'win32'`; other platforms
  resolve from PyPI unchanged. Measured on an RTX 3070 Ti, 2000 chunks
  embedded at **1497/s on cuda vs 80/s on cpu (~19×)**; ingest is where that
  lands, since a single query embedding is overhead-dominated either way.
- **`chunking.chars: 900`, `chunking.overlap: 150`** — chunking is
  character-based (cheap, model-agnostic), but MiniLM truncates its input at
  ~256 word-pieces, roughly 1000 characters. A chunk longer than that has its
  tail silently embedded into nothing — unsearchable text with no error. 900
  stays under that ceiling with margin; the 150-char overlap keeps a sentence
  that straddles a chunk boundary findable from either side.
- **`retrieval.hybrid: true`, `retrieval.rrf_k: 60`** — hybrid search fuses
  vector (semantic) and FTS5 (lexical, BM25) rankings via Reciprocal Rank
  Fusion, so an exact term or proper noun the embedder blurs together still
  surfaces. `60` is the standard damping constant from the original RRF
  paper — no need to tune it. Lexical fusion is skipped automatically (falls
  back to pure vector search) if the local SQLite build lacks FTS5.
- **`retrieval.chat_k` (8) > `retrieval.search_k` (6)** — the graph-free
  sources chat retrieves more passages per query because that retrieval is
  the *only* grounding the answer gets — there's no paper full-text and no
  follow-up search to fall back on.

## `pdf` — open-access PDF mining

Fetch-and-mine settings for papers without an ar5iv render (see
`services/pdf`): full text for the researcher's full reads and
caption-anchored figures/tables/algorithms for the detail panel. The
storage design behind these knobs — why whole PDFs are cached and images
are not — is written up in [pdf-mining.md](pdf-mining.md).

- **`max_bytes: 26214400` (25 MB)** — aborts a download mid-stream, since a
  Content-Length header can lie or be missing. Virtually every paper PDF is
  a few MB; the cap is about a mislabeled/hostile URL, not typical papers.
- **`timeout: 60`** — PDFs are much bigger than the JSON the provider
  timeouts were sized for, so downloads get their own, longer clock.
- **`cache_files: 200`** — the on-disk PDF cache (`data_dir/pdf_cache`,
  LRU-pruned). At ~2 MB per typical paper that's ~400 MB worst case;
  mined text/floats stay in the SQLite cache for a month either way, so an
  evicted PDF only costs a re-download when its figures are next *rendered*.
- **`research_papers: {max_floats: 12, max_pages: 80}`** — mining caps for
  open-access *paper* PDFs: the pymupdf twin of the ar5iv extractor's
  8-figure cap (slightly higher because tables and algorithm boxes count
  too), and a page cap that keeps a mislabeled 1000-page scan from stalling
  a panel open.
- **`library_documents: {max_floats: 400, max_pages: 1500}`** — the same caps for
  *uploaded library* PDFs, sized for textbooks instead of papers — one
  sub-object per corpus, because limits tuned for papers were silent data
  loss on books: they truncated Sutton & Barto at page 80 / 12 figures,
  making chapter 12's figures unaddressable (the Sarsa(λ) incident in
  `docs/bugs.md`). A 548-page book mines cover-to-cover in ~6 s, once,
  cached.
- **`render_dpi: 150`** — mined floats are served as page-region renders
  (vector figures have no embedded image to extract); 150 dpi reads crisply
  in the panel and lightbox without ballooning image bytes.
