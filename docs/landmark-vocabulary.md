# Landmark vocabulary — every term, with a toy example

The graph decides two things for every seed: **how many** citers to show as
*Field Landmarks*, and **where in time** the *Latest Publications* bands start.
The code for both is small. The vocabulary around it is not, and several terms
sound like each other while meaning very different things.

This page is the single definition of each term. Everything else — the two code
modules, three ML pipelines, three research notebooks, the integration READMEs —
**links here rather than restating**, so there's one place a definition can
change. If you're reading a term for the first time, read this page first; it
assumes nothing.

The **why** behind these choices lives in
[`predict-vs-compute.md`](predict-vs-compute.md). This page is only the *what*.

> **The distinction stopped being user-facing in v7.17.0.** Every term below

## The one example everything refers to

Almost every term below is about walking a seed's citers. Here is the walk, with
seven citers and a deliberately tiny cap of 2 (the real cap is 12):

```
The seed's citers, RANKED most-cited first.
Each is labelled with ITS OWN publication year:

  rank:    0      1      2      3      4      5      6
  year:  2020   2020   2020   2019   2018   2020   2017
```

Both rules walk this list left to right, dropping each citer into a bucket named
by its year — the counting-sort image is exact. Both enforce the same invariant:
**no bucket may exceed the cap**. They differ in one word — what happens when a
citer lands on a full bucket.

### Rule 1 — STOP at the first overflow

```
number_of_ranked_citers_before_a_single_year_overflows(years, cap=2)

  rank 0  2020  ->  bucket 2020 = 1   admit
  rank 1  2020  ->  bucket 2020 = 2   admit
  rank 2  2020  ->  bucket 2020 = 3   OVERFLOWS -> STOP THE WALK

  => 2
```

It returns **a count**: how many citers it admitted before quitting. Ranks 3–6
are never looked at, even though buckets 2019, 2018 and 2017 are empty. That
loss is not a bug — it is the defining property, and the reason this rule is
*only* ever used as a training label (see **label** below).

### Rule 2 — SKIP the full bucket and keep walking

```
select_up_to_cap_per_year(years, cap=2)

  rank 0  2020  ->  bucket 2020 = 1   admit
  rank 1  2020  ->  bucket 2020 = 2   admit
  rank 2  2020  ->  bucket FULL       SKIP, keep walking
  rank 3  2019  ->  bucket 2019 = 1   admit
  rank 4  2018  ->  bucket 2018 = 1   admit
  rank 5  2020  ->  bucket FULL       SKIP, keep walking
  rank 6  2017  ->  bucket 2017 = 1   admit

  => [0, 1, 3, 4, 6]
```

It returns **indices**, not a count — the specific citers to ship. Five
landmarks spanning 2017–2020, where Rule 1 stopped at two, both crammed into
2020.

**This is the single most important distinction on this page.** Same cap, same
input, same invariant; one ships a clump, the other ships a spread. Rule 2 is
what the app actually serves. Rule 1 exists only to train a model.

Real numbers, on DQN: Rule 1 stops at 29 landmarks with 2020 full and ships
*nothing from 2024–2025*, leaving an 18-month hole before the Latest frontier.
Rule 2 ships 84 — twelve in each of 2019–2025 — and closes it.

## The objects

**seed** — the paper at the centre of the graph. Everything is measured relative
to it.

**citer** — a paper that cites the seed. Note the direction: the seed *has*
citations; each one arrives *from* a citer. When something is "ranked", it means
ranked by the **citer's own** citation count, most-cited first — not by the
seed's.

**pool** — the set of citers a build holds in memory at the moment it decides
what to ship. Whether there *is* a pool is the hinge the whole design turns on
(see [`predict-vs-compute.md`](predict-vs-compute.md)):

| path | has a pool at decision time? | so it must | and its band is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAlex | **Yes, enough** — the STOP rule is prefix-local, and its one server-sorted page holds everything the rule reads *(the v5.13.0 realization; it read "No" here before, which is why a model served this path)* | **compute** N | a prefix |
| offline corpus | **Effectively yes** — its query already ranks the whole pool narrow; the rule runs between the fetch's two phases | **compute** N *(since v5.11.0)* | a prefix |
| live S2, **complete** (list ends before the ceiling — most seeds) | **Yes** — the pool is the whole history | **compute** N *(since v5.13.0)* | a prefix |
| live S2, **truncated** (the ceiling cut it off) | **Yes** — but it's a recency sliver | **compute** the selection | banded |

So the trained model now serves **no path at all** — retired v5.13.0, and its
code deleted in the 2026-07-22 research reset (see
[`predict-vs-compute.md`](predict-vs-compute.md)'s epilogue).

Note the last column moves independently of the middle one. *Predict vs compute* is
about **where the number comes from**; *prefix vs banded* is about **which rule**,
and that turns on the **pool's shape**, not on cost. A prefix of a whole-history
ranking is the giants — what a landmark is — and OpenAlex, the corpus, and a
complete live pool all have one. A truncated live pool is a recency sliver with no
all-time ranking to prefix, so a prefix there strands the recent years (DQN's top
29 are all 2019–2023); it bands instead. Conflating those two axes is easy and was
the mistake that produced this page's first draft.

**landmark** — a citer shipped as a *Field Landmark* node. The claim a landmark
makes is precise: *"one of the most-cited papers to cite this seed **in year
Y**."* A citer with no publication year can't make that claim and is dropped,
not bucketed.

**reachable** — how deep S2's citer feed can actually be paged. Its endpoint
400s past an offset of 8,000 (`_MAX_OFFSET`), and each page holds 1,000, so
8,000 + 1,000 = **9,000 citers** (`REACHABLE_CITERS`) is everything the live
path can ever see, no matter how many exist.

**truncated pool** — a pool cut off by that ceiling. It holds the **newest**
~9,000 citers, so it is a *recency slice*, not a sample. For a mega-cited paper
the slice can be brutally thin: *Attention Is All You Need* has 180,215 citers,
and its newest 9,000 are **all from a single year**. A rule run on a truncated
pool is exact *about that slice* — which is not the same as being right about
the paper.

---

## The two rules, and their cap

**per-year cap** (`PER_YEAR_CAP = 12`) — how many same-year citers a landmark
view tolerates before that year reads as a pile-up. One constant behind both
rules. Fit by sweep, not hand-picked.

**`number_of_ranked_citers_before_a_single_year_overflows`** — Rule 1 above. The
STOP rule. Returns a count. Originally the retired model's **training label** (a
regression label has to be a scalar); now, via `computed_cite_limit`, only the
**serving rule for every whole-history pool** (the corpus since v5.11.0; OpenAlex
and complete live S2 pools since v5.13.0).
Formerly `density_budget`, and written **`n*`** throughout the older notes.

**`select_up_to_cap_per_year`** — Rule 2 above. The SKIP rule. Returns indices.
This is what ships on the live S2 path's **truncated** pools (a complete live
pool computes Rule 1 instead). Formerly `density_selection_rule`.

**`select_landmarks`** — the app-facing wrapper around Rule 2: applies the
`UNBOUNDED_LANDMARK_CAP` payload guard, logs. Formerly `density_selection`
(and, until the v6.0.0 config purge, the reader of the deleted
`graph.adaptive_cite_limit` toggle and `graph.cite_limit` ceiling).

> **Why two functions per rule?** Each rule exists twice — a **pure** version
> that takes its cap as an argument, and a serving wrapper that adds the
> payload guard and the log line. The pure half exists so pipelines and
> studies can run *the exact serving rule* over any cap. Pure rules are named
> for their mechanics; wrappers are named for their job.

## The model side (retired)

The landmark budget was once sized by a **trained model**. It was retired from
serving (v5.13.0) and its code deleted entirely in the 2026-07-22 research reset
(see [`predict-vs-compute.md`](predict-vs-compute.md)). These terms survive here
only because older entries, the "three senses of anchor" below, and `history.md`
still reference them:

- **label** — a model's ground-truth training target. Rule 1's scalar output was
  that label — a regression target has to be a single number, which is the whole
  reason a rule everyone agrees is worse than Rule 2 ever existed. Rule 1 is now
  simply the serving rule for whole-history pools; the label role is history.
- **feature** — the model's two inputs (`FEATURE_NAMES`): `age` (years from the
  **age origin** to now) and `log_cites` (`log10(seed citations + 1)`).
- **age origin** — *which paper's year `age` was measured from*: the seed's own
  year (what the model trained on) vs. the oldest reachable citer (proposed for
  truncated pools, which don't span the seed→now gap — DQN reads as a dense
  7-year history, not a 13-year classic). Older notes call the second
  **"re-anchoring"**; prefer "age origin" ("anchor" is overloaded three ways,
  below).
- **`predicted_budget`** (formerly `model_budget`) and **`adaptive_cite_limit`**
  — the model's serving call and its config toggle; both deleted (v5.13.0 / the
  v6.0.0 config purge).

**exact / computable** vs **predicted** — a distinction that mattered while both
existed. "Exact" (still live) means *computed by running the rule over a real
pool*, not estimated by the model; a claim about the arithmetic, **not** about the
pool being representative — on a truncated pool a count can be exactly computed and
still about the wrong slice.

---

## The Latest-band side

Different model, different module (`bands.py`), same seed.

**band** — one year's worth of *Latest Publications*, filled by its own query.
"Banding" means grouping per year rather than taking a single ranking across the
whole window.

**tail edge** — the recent edge of the landmark cluster: scanning back from the
newest landmark year, the first year whose landmark count is still at least
`tau` of the **peak** year's count. It answers "where does the cluster actually
thin out?"

**`tau`** (`0.25`) — the fraction of the peak a year must reach to still count as
part of the cluster. Scale-free, so it works on a 30-landmark seed and a
160-landmark one alike. Fit on **misdate-robustness**, not on gap closure:
appending two citers dated two years into the future moves 58/64 seeds' edges at
`tau=0.10`, but only 1/64 at `tau=0.25`.

**`max_span`** (`7`) — a pure cost cap: the band start never reaches back more
than 7 years before the landmark cutoff, so an ancient seed can't spawn dozens of
throttled per-year queries. Worst case `7 + 2 = 9` band queries.

**`band_start`** — the first year the bands cover: the tail edge, floored by
`max_span`. There is **no "only widen" clamp** — a young seed starts at its own
recent edge.

**`MIN_LANDMARK_YEARS`** (`10`) — below this many dated landmark years the edge is
too noisy to trust, and the seed falls back to the fixed span.

**Why a rule with fitted constants, not a model?** Predicting the boundary from
seed features was tried and scored a **negative** cross-validated R² (−0.15) —
worse than guessing the mean. The boundary depends on the *shape* of each seed's
landmark distribution, which age and citation count don't capture. So: learn the
constants offline, run the rule online.

---

## "Anchor" means three unrelated things

The worst word in the codebase. Always disambiguate:

1. **A worked-example paper.** The four seeds carried through every study —
   Hawking Radiation, DQN, QMIX, *Attention Is All You Need* — kept so a
   number that looks absurd gets caught before any aggregate hides it. In the
   corpora this is the **`is_worked_example`** column (formerly `is_anchor`).
2. **The age origin.** Where the retired model's `age` feature was measured from
   (above). Older notes say "re-anchoring". This has **nothing** to do with sense 1.
3. **Force-graph node pinning.** Pure homonym, frontend only
   (`frontend/src/graph/hooks/`) — fixing a node's position on the canvas.
   Nothing to do with citers, budgets, or models.

## A note on older names

Entries in [`history.md`](history.md) are version-tagged records of what shipped
at the time and deliberately keep the **old** names — `density_budget`,
`density_selection`, `DENSITY_CAP`, `n*`, `is_anchor`. They are correct *there*.
This table maps them:

| Old name | Current name |
| --- | --- |
| `density_budget`, `n*` | `number_of_ranked_citers_before_a_single_year_overflows` |
| `density_selection_rule` | `select_up_to_cap_per_year` |
| `density_selection` | `select_landmarks` |
| `model_budget` | `predicted_budget` |
| `DENSITY_CAP` | `PER_YEAR_CAP` |
| `is_anchor` | `is_worked_example` |
| "re-anchoring" | choosing the **age origin** |
