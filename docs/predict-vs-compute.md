# Predict or compute? — models vs. banding in the citation budgets

A design question Patrick raised (2026-07-16) while revisiting the S2 live
fallback: *why does the live path band landmarks per year while OpenAlex uses
the cite-budget model — shouldn't we just train an S2-specific model? And why
band Latest Publications at all instead of predicting its size and density
too?* Working through it produced a principle the next budgeting decision
should reuse, so it's written down here.

This page is the **why**. For the *what* — precise definitions of every term
below (pool, reachable, label, the two rules, `tau`, the three senses of
"anchor"), each with a worked example — see
[`landmark-vocabulary.md`](landmark-vocabulary.md). Companion tickets live in
[`../OnePager.md`](../OnePager.md) (Backlog → Citations & graph data: the
corpus-models ticket and the live-path age-origin ticket); the history
behind the examples is in [`history.md`](history.md) (v4.5.0, v4.6.0, v5.5.0)
and [`bugs.md`](bugs.md).

## One rule, two regimes

Everything in the landmark budget serves one invariant: **don't let any one
publication year flood the graph past a legible cap (`PER_YEAR_CAP` = 12)**.
The apparent inconsistency between the paths — a trained model here, explicit
per-year banding there — is that same invariant enforced in two regimes, and which
regime applies is dictated by the provider's API, not by taste:

- **Predict (OpenAlex — the regime as originally argued; see the epilogue for
  how it emptied).** Landmarks come from a server-side
  `cites:…&sort=cited_by_count:desc&limit=N` query, so N must be chosen
  *before any citer is fetched*. Running the rule exactly would mean — the
  argument went — downloading the seed's whole citer list (~30k for DQN) just
  to throw most of it away. This looked like the one place a prediction earns
  its keep: the `cite_budget` model estimates, from two cheap seed features
  (age, log-citations), where the **STOP rule** *would* stop. Its training
  label is literally that rule — "how many ranked citers before a single year
  overflows K=12" — so on a ranked pool, top-N with a well-chosen N **is** the
  per-year cap, learned rather than enforced. "Don't fetch a pool just to size
  a trim" was the model's whole rationale.
- **Compute (live S2).** S2's `/citations` endpoint has no server-side sort,
  so the build must page the entire reachable list regardless (to the list's
  end or the 9,000-citer ceiling). By selection time the full pool is in
  memory — and once it is, running the rule exactly is free
  (`budget.select_landmarks`, the **SKIP rule**: admit up to `PER_YEAR_CAP` per
  year, most-cited first within each, stepping over years already full).
  **Predicting what you can compute exactly is strictly worse**: you inherit the
  model's error and save nothing. That is why
  "train a new cite-budget model on S2 API pools" is a non-starter — it would
  be a predictor whose entire training distribution is available, in full, at
  serve time, every time. A model is only worth training when the decision
  needs inputs that won't be in hand at the moment of decision.

The asymmetry Patrick noticed is therefore real, but it tracks a real
asymmetry in the two APIs — OpenAlex sells sorted queries, live S2 sells an
unsorted feed — not an inconsistency in the design.

**The corpus is a "compute" path too.** The offline corpus serves ranked
all-history pools (so the model's premise *held* there, unlike the truncated
live pool) — but the data is local DuckDB, where a per-year grouped selection
is as cheap as a top-N. That speculation resolved as predicted: v5.11.0 made
the corpus compute exactly, leaving the model serving only the one path that —
it then seemed — genuinely couldn't compute: OpenAlex.

## Epilogue (v5.13.0): the predict regime emptied

The OpenAlex bullet's premise was quietly load-bearing and wrong: it assumed
running the rule needs the **whole** pool. It doesn't. The STOP rule is
**prefix-local** — it walks the ranking from the top and never reads past the
first year to overflow — and OpenAlex serves the ranking *server-sorted*, so
everything the rule will ever read sits in the first `per-page=200` response:
one request, the same one the predicted path was already making (computed
budgets across the 58-seed validation corpus: mean ~76, max 176; a seed whose
top-200 doesn't overflow pays for one ceiling-sized refetch). Patrick asked
the destabilizing question — "do we really need the budget model at all?" —
and the honest answer was no: OpenAlex now computes the label exactly
(`openalex._budgeted_landmarks`), which also restores the `PER_YEAR_CAP`
invariant a size-only prediction never could enforce.

The same release closed the other gap this page's regime table left open: a
live S2 pool whose citation list ends **before** the offset ceiling (most
seeds) is not a truncated sliver but the seed's *complete history* — so it now
ships the corpus shape outright (STOP-prefix landmarks, tau-banded Latest)
instead of the sliver's SKIP-banding and rolling window
(`semantic_scholar.traversal._complete_pool_relations`).

The model was retired from serving in v5.13.0, and its code and artifact were
removed entirely in the 2026-07-22 research reset (the whole `ml_pipelines/` +
`research/` apparatus was torn out to restart the research effort). What survives
is the principle, not the model: *predict only what you can't observe* — with the
amendment that "what you can't observe" must be checked against what the rule
actually reads, not against the size of the pool it's defined over.

## Why Latest is banded, not predicted

Two reasons, one structural, one measured:

- **A scalar can't express a distribution.** "Ship 40 latest nodes" doesn't
  say *where in time they go*, and recency and citation count are inversely
  correlated (new papers haven't had time to accumulate citations), so any
  single ranking over the recent window collapses to one of its ends — all
  boundary-year papers or all last-month papers. "Every recent year gets a
  fair slice" is inherently a distribution, not a number. The v5.5.0
  landmark hole ("a count can't express the answer" — a top-N prefix over a
  truncated pool stranded 2024–2025 entirely) is the same lesson on the
  other relation. The citation-velocity backlog ticket is the one live
  attempt at a self-balancing *single* ranking; that's why it's filed as a
  candidate **within-band** ranking, not a replacement for bands.
- **The pure-model version was tried and failed.** The `latest_gap` study
  (v4.6.0) fit a regression on seed age + log-citations to predict the Latest
  band start and scored **negative cross-validated R²** — "seed features
  can't predict the boundary" was the study's written finding (the `latest_gap`
  study, removed in the 2026-07-22 research reset). What won was a rule with two
  *learned constants*: `tau=0.25` / `max_span=7`, fit offline on
  misdate-robustness and now inlined as `bands.TAU` / `bands.MAX_SPAN`;
  `bands.earliest_band_year` runs the rule exactly on the actual landmark year
  distribution at serve time.

## The house pattern

| Situation | What we do |
|---|---|
| The decision must be made **before** the data the rule reads exists (no current example — see the epilogue: what the rule *reads* is the test, not the pool's size) | **Predict it** — a trained model on cheap seed features (`ml_pipelines/`) |
| Everything the rule reads is **in hand** at serve time (the corpus; OpenAlex's first ranked page; the live S2 pool, complete or truncated) | **Run the rule exactly** — no model |
| The rule has tunable constants (`tau`, `max_span`, the cap of 12) | **Fit them offline** from data — never hand-pick |

One sentence: *learn constants offline, execute rules online, predict only
what you can't observe.* This is the precise form of the repo's
"data-driven over magic numbers" principle — a trained model is not the only
data-driven artifact; a rule whose constants were fit from data is equally
data-driven and, where the distribution is local, strictly more accurate.

## Receipts

  never trained on" — what happens when a prediction is applied to a

  computation).

  switched from predicting to computing, and why a count can't express the
  answer).
- [`landmark-vocabulary.md`](landmark-vocabulary.md) — every term used above,
  defined once with worked examples.
- `src/curious_astronaut/services/graph/budget.py` (`select_landmarks`, `PER_YEAR_CAP`,
  `computed_cite_limit`) and `bands.py` (`earliest_band_year`, `TAU`,
  `max_span`) — the two rules as shipped.
