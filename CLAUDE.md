# CLAUDE.md — working agreement for this repo

Instructions for Claude Code when working in `~/PyCharmProjects/atlas`. Read this first;
it captures how we collaborate so you don't have to re-derive it each session.

## What this project is

**Curious Astronaut** — a Connected-Papers-style interactive citation/similarity graph
with (on the roadmap) an AI teacher that narrates the history and intuition of a
field. It connects to **Semantic Scholar** dynamically instead of storing a paper
corpus locally. The repo is named `curious-astronaut` on GitHub — its third
name, after `arxiv-digest` (the daily-digest era) → `atlas` (2026-07-17) →
`curious-astronaut` (2026-09-24, when the Atlas branding was retired: see
`docs/history.md`). Old remote URLs redirect, so stale clones keep working.
The Python package is `curious_astronaut`, the PyPI distribution is
`curious-astronaut`, and **the CLI is `astronaut`** (`astronaut serve`).

- **Vision, feature stack, and the open Backlog live in [OnePager.md](OnePager.md).**
  Keep it current. Read it to understand where we are and what's next. The
  shipped record (every shipped item's full story + version tag) lives in
  **[docs/history.md](docs/history.md)**; the notable-bugs log in
  **[docs/bugs.md](docs/bugs.md)** — split out 2026-07-16 so the OnePager stays
  a working document.
- Backend: Python/Flask + uv (`src/curious_astronaut/`, standard src-layout,
  installed editable). Frontend: React + TS +
  Vite (`frontend/`). Graph rendering via `react-force-graph-2d`.

## Session start — bootstrap first

**Before anything else, sync `main`.** Sessions may start on a stale checkout
(work happens from more than one machine), and running setup or the config
drift check against yesterday's tree defeats the point — sync first so the
steps below see the current `main`. Because of the worktree rule below, that
is **not** a plain `git pull`:

```
git fetch origin main:main      # update the local main without checking it out
git switch --detach main        # unless you're mid-feature on a branch already
```

**Worktrees: nobody owns `main`.** This repo is checked out as several git
worktrees side by side (`atlas-claude`, `atlas-codex`, …) sharing one object
store, one set of branches, one set of tags. Git allows a branch to be
checked out in **at most one** worktree at a time, so if any worktree sits on
`main`, every other one gets `fatal: 'main' is already used by worktree at …`
the moment it tries to merge. The convention (settled 2026-09-15): **`main`
is only ever checked out briefly, to merge or commit into, and released
straight afterwards** with `git switch --detach main`. Between features a
worktree rests on a detached HEAD at `main`'s tip, or on its feature branch —
never on `main` itself. If a merge hits that `fatal:`, some worktree forgot
to detach; fix it there (`git -C ../atlas-<other> switch --detach main`),
don't work around it.

**Then run the setup script**: `bin\setup.bat` on
Windows, `bin/setup.sh` on macOS/Linux. It installs the toolchain pinned in
`.tool-versions` via **mise** (python, uv, nodejs, trivy, gh — mise reads the
asdf-format file but, unlike asdf, works on Windows too), then
`uv sync --all-groups`s the backend (all dependency groups, so the notebook
`research` group survives the sync) and `npm install` + `npm run build`s the frontend. It's cheap when
everything is already current, and it prevents a whole class of stale-env
surprises (missing node modules, an out-of-date lockfile, nox silently
skipping the Trivy scan).

**Then check `config.json` against `config.example.json`.** `config.json` is the
real settings file and is **gitignored**, so it drifts from the tracked template
whenever a setting lands **or is deleted**. At session start, diff the two — in
*both* directions: a key present in `config.example.json` but missing from
`config.json` (or a shape that no longer matches) means the local file is stale —
flag it and fill in the gap (carrying over the example's default); a key present
in `config.json` but **gone from the template** is worse than stale — `config.py`
is `extra="forbid"`, so the leftover key **fails app startup** — delete it from
the local file. Do all this before anything that depends on config. Don't touch
`config.example.json` to match `config.json` — the template leads, the local
file follows.

## How we work together — the loop

For each feature, follow this cycle:

0. **Branch off `main` for a major feature** — before starting a substantial
   feature/ticket, cut a fresh branch from an up-to-date `main`, named
   **`feature/<short-name>`** (`git switch -c feature/<short-name> main`). All
   the work below happens on that branch, keeping `main` clean and tidy.
   (Research problems get the same treatment against the `research` trunk —
   **`problem/<short-name>`** — see "Research & analysis work".) **Working
   branches live locally by default: don't push them to origin.** The
   deliberate exception is when the developer explicitly wants one on their
   other machine, and says so. **Skip the branch for lightweight,
   doc-only changes** — updating READMEs, other markdown, `CLAUDE.md`,
   `OnePager.md`, or `docs/` (e.g. filing `todos.md`, moving a shipped item to
   `docs/history.md`) — those commit straight to `main`: `git switch main`,
   commit, push, then `git switch --detach main` to release it again (see
   "Worktrees" under "Session start").
1. **Build** the feature. Run `npm run build --prefix frontend` to typecheck the
   frontend; verify backend changes with a quick script or the Flask test client.
   Run the whole quality gate — backend *and* frontend — with **`uv run nox`**
   (see below) before handing off.
2. **Hand off for testing** — the developer tests it **in the browser themselves**
   first. Give them specific things to check. **Do NOT commit until they approve.**
3. On approval, **update the docs**: `README.md`, plus the OnePager/history
   split — **move the shipped item's entry out of `OnePager.md`'s Backlog and
   into `docs/history.md`'s matching theme section**, ticked `[x]` and keeping
   its full story + version tag (history entries stay verbatim; the Backlog
   only ever holds open work). If a **notable bug** was found & fixed along the
   way — non-obvious root cause, surprising repro, a lesson worth keeping — add
   an entry to **`docs/bugs.md`** (newest-first; see its
   header for the format). It has two halves: **Ours** (we wrote it, we fixed
   it) and **Upstream** (a provider's data/service is wrong — we can only work
   around it, so the entry justifies code that looks paranoid and stops a later
   cleanup deleting the guard). File by *where the root cause lives*, not who
   noticed it.
   Small, obvious fixes don't need one — the commit message is enough.
4. **Commit on the branch, merge into `main`, tag, and push** (details below) —
   commit the approved work on the feature branch, merge it back into `main`,
   then tag and push in lockstep. The feature branch can be deleted once merged.

Don't skip ahead: no committing before the browser test, no starting the next
phase without a green light. The developer is hands-on and likes to eyeball UX
before it's locked in.

**Browser automation (Claude in Chrome) is ask-first.** Driving the developer's
browser is slow, so don't reach for it by default — tests, quick scripts, and
the Flask test client cover almost everything. When a problem genuinely needs
the live app (e.g. a bug only reproducible in the real browser), ask the developer
before launching it; they'll usually allow it when it's really needed.

## Research & analysis work

Research lives on the long-lived **`research` branch** (spun off `main`,
2026-07-25), not on `main`: the `research/` tree (problems → workstreams →
loops), the notebooks, *and the `research` skill itself*
(`.claude/skills/research/SKILL.md` — deliberately absent from `main`). For
any research, analysis, model-fitting, constant-tuning, corpus study, or
"derive a rule from the data" task: **switch to the `research` branch** (or a
**`problem/<short-name>`** branch off it — the research trunk mirrors the main
line's workflow: problem branches merge back into `research`, never into
`main`, and live locally by default like feature branches, pushed to origin
only when the developer wants one on their other machine), and **invoke the
`research` skill there** *before* writing analysis
code or explaining a finding. The skill defines the shape of the work — frame
+ build intuition *once*, then open-ended workstreams that each loop
hypothesis → experiment → results — and an explicit list of things not to do.
Build shared understanding first, and test only a stated hypothesis.

One mechanical caveat: because the skill is absent from `main`, a later
`git merge main` into `research` will try to **delete** the skill (and any
other research-branch-only file `main` later touches). After syncing
`research` with `main`, verify `.claude/skills/research/` survived — restore
it with `git checkout research -- .claude/skills/research` if the merge
dropped it.

## The `todos.md` inbox

The developer brainstorms on the fly while I'm building, so `todos.md` at the repo
root is a scratch **inbox** — not a durable list. When they point me at it (or
bring it up at the start of a session), I:

1. **File** each item into `OnePager.md`'s Backlog — into the theme section
   where it fits ("Enhancements & tech debt", "UI & rendering polish", …) so
   the OnePager stays the single source of truth for open work.
2. **Clear** each item out of `todos.md` as I file it, leaving it an empty inbox
   (just the `TODOs:` header) for the next round.

OnePager wins — its Backlog items move to `docs/history.md` as we ship.
`todos.md` is gitignored scratch; never treat leftover items there as
authoritative.

## Release mechanics

**The full runbook is [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md)** — what a tag push
does, the out-of-repo setup (trusted publishing, the two pending publishers, the
environment rules), how to rehearse without releasing, and how to recover when a
release fails partway or a bad version lands. Read it before your first release;
the steps below are the short form.

> **Pushing a `v*` tag publishes to PyPI.** Step 5 below is therefore the
> irreversible step — a PyPI version can never be replaced, only yanked.

- **Versioning:** SemVer. **`v1.0.0`** is the Curious Astronaut pivot (the graph
  explorer replacing the old digest). From here: new feature = **minor**
  (`1.0.0` → `1.1.0`), bug fix = **patch**, breaking change = **major**. Bump
  `version` in `pyproject.toml`, then run `uv lock`. (History: the `0.x` line was
  the earlier "daily digest" era, ending at `v0.11.0`.)
- **Commit:** stage files **explicitly**. End
  the message with a `Co-Authored-By` trailer naming **the Claude model actually
  writing the commit** (don't copy an old commit's trailer verbatim), e.g.:

  ```
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```
- **Merge into `main`:** the approved work is built on a feature branch (see the
  loop's step 0); `git switch main` and merge it (`--no-ff`) before tagging so
  the tag lands on `main`.
- **Tag in lockstep:** create an **annotated** tag `vX.Y.Z` matching the
  `pyproject.toml` version, on the merge commit.
- **Push:** `git push origin main --follow-tags` — **this publishes to PyPI**
  (`--follow-tags` sends the tag, and the tag is the trigger). To land the code
  without releasing, push `main` alone and hold the tag back.
- **Release `main` and clean up:** `git switch --detach main` so no worktree
  owns the branch (see "Worktrees" under "Session start"), then delete the
  feature branch (`git branch -d feature/<short-name>`).

The repo is **public** (`github.com/patrickjames0132/curious-astronaut`, MIT, created
2026-06-28), default branch `main`. *(This line said "private" until
2026-08-09; the GitHub API says otherwise, so it was stale. Two things follow
from public that are easy to get wrong: **GitHub Actions minutes are free and
unlimited** on standard runners, so the CI matrix costs nothing; and the
"public, timestamped release" prior-art defense in
[docs/licensing.md](docs/licensing.md) is **already satisfied by this repo** —
it does not wait on a PyPI release.)*

## Code conventions

- **No single-letter identifiers.** Name every variable, parameter, loop target,
  and generic type parameter for what it *holds*, in both the backend and the
  frontend — `node` not `n`, `event` not `e`, `query` not `q`, `top_k` not `k`,
  `Item` not `T`. This applies to tight scopes too (`.map((node) => …)`,
  `catch (error)`, `(prev) => …` in a `setState` updater). The exceptions are
  external property names we don't own (e.g. react-force-graph's `node.x`/`.y`,
  a paper's `_s`/`_t` endpoint fields) and canvas coordinates where a longer
  name reads worse — but a *local* coordinate still gets a real name (`lineX`,
  not `x`). Established two- to three-letter shorthands already in the code
  (`ctx`, `fg`, `lo`/`hi`, `aid`, `err`, `msg`, `buf`, `frac`) are fine; the
  rule is specifically about single letters. The whole codebase was swept clean
  of them once — keep it that way, don't reintroduce them. **Machine-enforced
  on both sides**, with `_` the one allowed single character (the pure-discard
  idiom) and property *access* out of scope on both:
  - **Backend, since v5.3.0** — a pre-commit hook (`check_identifiers.py`,
    an AST walker) fails the gate on any single-letter *binding* in `.py`
    files and `.ipynb` code cells alike.
  - **Frontend, since v6.9.0** — oxlint's **`id-length`** rule
    (`frontend/.oxlintrc.json`, `min: 2`, `properties: "never"`) over `src/`
    and `test/`. Because `properties: "never"` exempts accesses but *not* TS
    property signatures, the few external field names declared in our own
    types (`VNode`'s `x`/`y`, the `q` search wire key) carry a scoped
    `oxlint-disable id-length` plus a comment saying whose name it is —
    that comment is the point, so don't strip them.
- **The in-app help tracks the UI.** The frontend teaches itself in three
  places: the guided tour's step text (`frontend/src/tour/steps.ts`), the
  one-line gesture/hint lines inside components (e.g. GraphControls'
  `select-hint` and `ctrl-hint`), and control tooltips (`title=`). When a
  change alters what a component *does* — a new gesture, a button's behavior,
  a control appearing/disappearing — **update every help surface that
  describes it in the same change**, or the tour confidently teaches the old
  UI. (Rule born 2026-07-17: the Esc clear-all shipped while the tour still
  taught alt-click-empty as the only clear.)
- **Every package has a README, kept current.** A new package — backend or
  frontend, nested sub-packages included (e.g. `graph/canvas/`,
  `teacher/transcript/`) — ships **with its own `README.md`** telling that
  package's full story (what it is, design decisions worth knowing, who uses
  it, how it's verified — match the established README voice). And when a
  code change alters a package's behavior, structure, or contracts,
  **refactor its README in the same change** — including any *other* README
  that names the moved/changed thing (`src/README.md`'s render-tree map,
  cross-references like `notation/README.md`). `frontend/src/README.md`'s
  claim that "every folder has its own README" must stay true.

## Caveats — read before committing

- **Secrets:** `.env` is gitignored — never commit it. `.env.example` holds only
  placeholders. All API keys (`S2_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) are
  optional; the app runs keyless (just rate-limited on Semantic Scholar).
- **Don't commit** `data/` (the SQLite cache) or `frontend/dist/` — both
  gitignored.
- **Licensing:** the project is **MIT** (`LICENSE`; every source file carries a
  copyright/`Description:`/`Authors:` header — see `docs/licensing.md`). **If
  the developer ever opens the project to outside contributions (a PR from anyone
  but them, a collaborator, a `CONTRIBUTING` guide, a CLA), remind them to relicense
  MIT → Apache-2.0 *first*** — the patent clauses matter once other contributors
  exist, and relicensing is far cleaner before their rights enter the codebase.
  The reasoning is settled in `docs/licensing.md`; don't re-litigate it.

## Technical notes

- **Semantic Scholar rate limits are real.** The single-paper GET (`/paper/{id}`)
  429s almost immediately unauthenticated — hydrate details through
  `POST /paper/batch` instead. Recommendations need `from=all-cs` (the default
  "recent" pool returns nothing for older seeds). Graph snapshots are cached in
  `data/cache.db` (`cache` table, 1-day TTL). Encourage setting `S2_API_KEY`.
- **Run backend:** `uv run astronaut serve` (Python 3.14 in `.venv`; the
  console script comes from the editable src-layout install — `cli.py`).
- **Optional extras (v7.15.0).** `sources` (sentence-transformers + torch),
  `pdf` (PyMuPDF) and `corpus` (DuckDB) are `[project.optional-dependencies]`,
  not core — 83 MB vs 1.0 GB. **Import them only through
  `curious_astronaut.optional.require`, never at module scope**; a test walks the tree and
  fails otherwise. `bin/setup` installs all of them locally.
- **Logs:** `create_app()` logs to the console *and* a rotating file,
  `data/curious-astronaut.log` (5MB × 3 backups, gitignored with the rest of `data/`).
  Useful for after-the-fact debugging of agent runs (e.g. an S2 429 or search
  failure the UI only shows as a failed trace chip) — `grep` it for `WARNING`/
  `ERROR` after reproducing.
- **Quick backend checks:** `uv run python -c "from curious_astronaut.app import create_app; ..."`
  (no path shims needed — the package is installed) and Flask's
  `app.test_client()` — avoid hammering the live S2 API in tests.
- Don't re-hit the live API repeatedly while iterating; it throttles the IP
  (shared with the browser).

## Quality gate — `uv run nox` (backend + frontend)

**`uv run nox`** runs the whole repo's gate in one shot — five sessions defined
in `noxfile.py`, all reusing the uv env (no per-session installs).

**CI runs it too, since v6.10.0** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): every push to
`main`, on `ubuntu-latest` *and* `windows-latest`. Three things about it are
worth knowing before you edit either the workflow or `bin/setup.sh`:

- It **reuses `bin/setup.sh`** instead of restating the bootstrap, so CI can't
  drift from what you run locally. Change the bootstrap and CI follows.
- It sets **`CA_SKIP_TORCH=1`** (the guard in `bin/setup.{sh,bat}`), which
  since v7.15.0 drops the **`sources` extra** rather than deselecting a single
  package. Nothing in the gate needs torch — `sentence_transformers` is
  imported lazily in `services/sources/embeddings.py`'s `_get_model` and the
  embedding tests inject a fake module — while a full Linux sync pulls the 37
  `nvidia-*` CUDA packages the lockfile resolves there (1.0 GB → 304 MB). The
  `pdf` and `corpus` extras **are** installed in CI: their tests build real
  PDFs and query real Parquet. **Side effect worth preserving: CI fails if
  anything imports an optional package at module scope**, which is what keeps
  those lazy imports honest. Don't "fix" a CI-only ImportError by installing
  the extra in CI — fix the eager import, via `curious_astronaut.optional.require`.
- It runs **`npm run build` as a separate step**, because no nox session
  typechecks the frontend (`tsc -b`). Adding a nox session for it would let
  that step be dropped; today the two are deliberately both present.

`release.yml` fires on `v*` tags, asserts the tag matches `pyproject.toml`'s
version — the one automated check on the otherwise manual release ritual — and
**since v8.2.0 also builds and publishes to PyPI**. Pushing a `v*` tag now
builds the frontend, builds the sdist + wheel, verifies the artifacts, uploads
to **TestPyPI**, and then uploads to **PyPI**. The runbook is
[docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md); four things are worth knowing here
because they constrain how you edit the workflow:

- **A tag push is now an irreversible outward action.** A PyPI version can never
  be replaced, only yanked. The `pypi` job sits behind a GitHub **environment**
  of the same name, which is where a required reviewer is configured, so the
  upload can be made to wait for a human click.
- **Publishing uses trusted publishing (OIDC), not a token** — nothing secret is
  stored. The trade: PyPI's publisher config names this repo, **the workflow
  filename, and the environment**, so renaming `release.yml` or either
  environment silently breaks publishing until PyPI is updated to match.
- **`npm run build` must precede `uv build`**, because `hatch_build.py` bundles
  the frontend only when it's there and skips quietly when it isn't — so the
  wrong order yields a *valid* wheel that serves the "Frontend not built yet"
  hint. The workflow's `Verify artifacts` step asserts the bundle landed, along
  with the no-`config.json`/`.env`/`data/` audit that keeps local secrets out of
  a permanent upload.
- **`workflow_dispatch` publishes to TestPyPI on demand** — no inputs, TestPyPI
  only. That's how to exercise the pipeline without cutting a tag. There is
  deliberately no manual route to PyPI: the `pypi` environment permits only
  `v*` tags, so an option for it would be a button that always fails. The
  `if: github.ref_type == 'tag'` on the job and that deployment rule must stay
  in agreement — loosen one without the other and publishing either silently
  widens or starts failing.
- **The environment rules are part of the release path and live outside the
  repo.** Nothing in a diff, a test or a type check can see them. The two
  triggers produce **different ref types** — the dispatch runs on a *branch*,
  the release on a *tag* — so an environment serving both needs a rule for each.
  Required today: `testpypi` = branch `main` **and** tag `v*`; `pypi` = tag `v*`
  only. Getting this wrong fails *only* on the real trigger, since the rehearsal
  runs on a branch and passes regardless — that's how v8.2.0 died at
  `Tag "v8.2.0" is not allowed to deploy to testpypi` (see
  [docs/bugs.md](docs/bugs.md)).
- **`uv build` refuses a cache dir inside the source tree**, so `release.yml`
  sets no `UV_CACHE_DIR` even though `ci.yml` does. `ci.yml` gets away with it
  because `uv sync`/`uv run` don't care; `uv build` copies the tree to make the
  sdist and dies with "The cache directory `.uv-cache` is inside the build
  source directory". Don't "fix" the inconsistency by adding it back.

The five sessions:

- **`precommit`** — every pre-commit hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`): file
  hygiene + **ruff** lint (config in `pyproject.toml`; includes the
  **pydocstyle `D` rules, Google convention** — every module/class/function
  must carry a docstring; D205 deliberately off, the house style opens with
  flowing paragraphs) + **pydoclint** (docstring *completeness*: Args match
  the signature, Returns where a value comes back — config in
  `[tool.pydoclint]`; its raises-checks are off because the house style
  documents *propagated* exceptions too) + the repo-local
  **no-single-letter-identifiers** hook (`check_identifiers.py` — see
  "Code conventions" above; covers `.py` and `.ipynb`, ruff has no
  min-name-length rule) + the **frontend's format & lint** —
  prettier (config in `frontend/.prettierrc.json`, scoped to
  `src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}` + `test/` + `vite.config.ts`; READMEs and the JSONC
  tsconfigs stay hand-formatted) and oxlint (now incl. **jsdoc completeness
  rules**: a documented function's `@param`/`@returns` must be complete —
  presence isn't machine-checkable in oxlint, so JSDoc-on-every-function
  stays a convention, swept once 2026-07-10), as local hooks running the
  frontend's own npm scripts (they need `frontend/node_modules` — the
  session-start `bin/setup` installs it), plus **`id-length`**, the frontend
  half of the no-single-letter-identifiers convention (see "Code conventions").
  Prettier fixes in place like ruff `--fix`: a reformat fails the run so the
  changes get restaged.
- **`mypy`** — type-checks `src/curious_astronaut`, **strict since v1.21.1**: no
  `disable_error_code` entries and `check_untyped_defs = true`. Keep it that way —
  new code must type-check clean; don't reintroduce disabled codes. At SDK
  boundaries prefer isinstance narrowing on real types (see `teacher/agentic.py`)
  over `getattr` duck-typing, and use `flask.typing.ResponseReturnValue` for
  views that return `(body, status)` tuples.
- **`tests`** — `pytest` over `test/`, which **mirrors `src/curious_astronaut/`**
  (853 offline tests; no live arXiv/S2/Anthropic calls, ever). Shared fixtures
  in `test/conftest.py`: autouse temp-DB isolation (tests can't touch real
  `data/`), `fake_claude` (a scripted Anthropic client built from **real SDK
  event objects** — use it for anything agentic), and `stub_embeddings`
  (deterministic hash embedder, no torch). Put new tests in the folder matching
  the module under test; pass args through with `uv run nox -s tests -- -k foo`.
- **`vitest`** — the frontend suite: **Vitest** (+ RTL/jsdom) over
  `frontend/test/`, which **mirrors `frontend/src/`**; fully offline, node
  environment by default with per-file `// @vitest-environment jsdom` opt-in,
  no test globals (import from `vitest` explicitly). Skips cleanly without
  npm. See `frontend/test/README.md`; pass args through with
  `uv run nox -s vitest -- -t name`.
- **`security`** — **Trivy**, run twice with opposite failure policies (since
  v8.2.0). **Vulnerabilities fail the gate at HIGH or above**
  (`--exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL`); MEDIUM and LOW print without
  blocking. **Secrets only report**, and skip `config.json` and `.env` —
  both gitignored, both *meant* to hold live keys, so failing on them would
  leave the gate permanently red on any machine that has run the app; a key in
  a **tracked** file is still caught. Waive a specific finding in a
  `.trivyignore` with a comment saying why and when to revisit — don't raise
  `--severity` or drop the exit code. It still **skips cleanly when `trivy`
  isn't on PATH**, so the gate stays green locally without it; trivy is pinned
  in `.tool-versions`, so the session-start `bin/setup` installs it via mise and
  after bootstrap the scan should actually run, not skip. **Why it works this
  way:** until v8.2.0 this session ran `trivy fs` with no `--exit-code`, so it
  reported and then exited 0 — a CRITICAL `anyio` CVE printed inside a run whose
  summary said `security: success`, and shipped anyway (see
  [docs/bugs.md](docs/bugs.md)). Don't reintroduce a check that cannot fail.

**`git add` a brand-new file before running the gate.** pre-commit's
`--all-files` enumerates with `git ls-files`, so **untracked files are invisible
to every hook** — a new module can pass the gate and then fail the very next run
once it's staged. That is not hypothetical: `hatch_build.py` went in that way in
v8.1.0, and the moment it became tracked, ruff's isort reclassified
`from hatch_build import …` in `test/test_packaging.py` from third-party to
first-party and rewrote the import block (v8.2.0). Harmless there, but the same
blindness hides real lint and type errors in new code. Stage first, then run.

Run a single session with `uv run nox -s <name>` (e.g. `-s mypy`).
