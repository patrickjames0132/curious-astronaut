Description:
Saved explorations.

An **exploration** is a sitting at the app: the conversation you held, the
lectures you played, and a note of which graph was open while you held it.
Every exploration saves itself as you work (there is no Save button); the
frontend re-POSTs the same row on settled events, debounced.

**The conversation is the durable thing here, the graph is a reference.**
The blob carries chat, lectures and a ``graph_ref`` (the seed reference,
provider and layout needed to put the graph back) rather than the graph's
nodes and edges. Reopening rebuilds it — instantly when the 1-day snapshot
cache in cache.db is still warm, from the provider when it is not. That is
a deliberate trade Patrick made 2026-08-29: rows stay small and the chat
history is the spine, at the cost of rate-limited calls on a cold reopen and
a rebuilt graph that may differ from the one you left (citation data moves).

**One exception rides with the conversation:** the papers the *agent* pulled
in mid-chat (``discovered_nodes``/``discovered_edges``). No cache holds them
and no rebuild reproduces them — they are a product of the conversation, not
of the seed — so they are stored, and merged back over the rebuilt graph.

Explorations are durable user data with their own lifecycle, so they live in
their own ``sessions.db`` (like the bring-your-own sources), separate from
the ephemeral cache. The heavy state is JSON in the ``data`` column; a few
metadata columns are lifted out so the list view renders without parsing
every blob.

**Legacy saves still restore.** Rows written before 2026-08-29 carry the
whole graph inline (``nodes``/``edges``) and no ``graph_ref``; ``get_session``
hands the blob back as-is and the frontend uses whichever it finds, so an
old save keeps its exact papers instead of being rebuilt.

    fetched it — so the honest answer is the count the reference itself
    recorded when it was written (``graph_ref.n_nodes``) plus the discovered
    papers layered on top.

    The number is a **list-view hint, not a guarantee**: a rebuilt graph can
    come back a different size, because the provider's citation data moves
