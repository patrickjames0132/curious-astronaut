Description:
A thin TTL cache for dynamically-fetched artifacts (graph snapshots, ar5iv
full text and figures, Hugging Face code links).

Curious Astronaut deliberately does NOT store a paper corpus — millions of papers
are many TB and the ecosystem (Semantic Scholar / arXiv) already hosts them.
This is just a small key -> JSON-blob table so the app can respect Semantic
Scholar's tight rate limit and avoid re-fetching the same neighborhood on
every view.

Freshness is entirely the caller's decision: every value here is stamped
with when it was written, but nothing in this module decides what counts as
stale. Each caller passes its own ``max_age`` to ``get()`` — a graph
snapshot and an ar5iv figure have very different TTLs, and both share this
one table.
