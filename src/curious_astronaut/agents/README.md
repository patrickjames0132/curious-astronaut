# `agents`

The AI teacher, rebuilt as a crew of agents: one **orchestrator** delegating to
focused **sub-agents**, every agent defined by Pydantic objects (PydanticAI
`Agent`s wired from `config.llm.agents` entries) instead of the old repo's
hand-rolled Anthropic SDK loops.

**Status: COMPLETE.** The shared infrastructure (`events.py`,
`traversal.py`, `factory.py`, `prompts.py`, `skills/`), the
model-driven agents (`summarizer`,
`lecturer`, `researcher`),
and the `orchestrator` dispatcher are built and tested; the old
`teacher/` package is fully retired. What remains is wiring: routes call
`orchestrator.run(intent, ...)` in Phase 5. (`summarizer` arrived later,
v5.17.0: the detail panel's on-demand TL;DR — a one-shot micro-agent
called from `routes/graph.py`, never the orchestrator. `query_analyst`
was the other agent of that shape; it was retired in v7.6.0 when the
paper scout absorbed its job.)

## `events.py` — the typed event stream

A workflow (a lecture, a Q&A turn, a library chat) doesn't return one value —
it *streams*: narration arrives beat by beat, an agent's tool steps surface as
they happen, discovered papers merge into the live graph mid-answer.
`events.py` is that stream's vocabulary, as Pydantic models: every agent
yields these, the routes layer (Phase 5) serializes each one to an SSE frame
named by its `type` tag, and the frontend switches on the same tag. One
protocol for every workflow, declared in one file.

| Event       | Emitted by            | Meaning                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Beat`      | lecturer              | one narration paragraph + heading + nodes to light up          |
| `Token`     | researcher                 | a chunk of streamed answer prose                               |
| `Trace`     | researcher, orchestrator   | "watch the agent work" — one variant per action (below) |
| `Discovery` | researcher            | papers + edges to merge into the live graph — only growth that *attaches* (see below) |
| `Figure`    | researcher | a real figure attached to the answer — a paper's, or one mined from an uploaded PDF (`index=None`) |
| `Cited`     | researcher            | the node ids the answer draws on                               |
| `SourceRefs` | researcher, lecturer | `[Sn]` marker index → library source, sent *before* the prose  |
| `PaperRefs` | researcher            | `[n]` marker index → paper (title + URL + the provider that minted the id), for when there's no graph to resolve against |
| `Provenance` | researcher           | what actually grounded the answer — observed, not claimed      |
| `Done`      | every workflow        | clean finish — always last on success                          |
| `Error`     | every workflow        | failure — always last, so the frontend never hangs             |

Design points worth knowing:

- **Two nested discriminated unions.** `Event` discriminates on `type`;
  its trace member is itself a union of five variants (`ReadTrace`,
  `ExpandTrace`, `SearchTrace`, `SourceSearchTrace`, `FigureTrace`)
  discriminating on `action`. One
  `validate_python` call resolves both levels — a raw
  `{"type": "trace", "action": "read", ...}` dict comes back as a
  `ReadTrace`. The old teacher passed loose `{"action": ..., ...}` dicts
  whose shapes you had to reverse-engineer from five `_run_*` functions.
- **`SearchTrace` records which corpus it ran against** (`provider`, v7.30.0)
  — on the pending announcement as well as the finished report, since the
  pending chip is what the reader stares at for the whole run. It is on the
  event rather than inferred from the workspace at render time so a saved
  turn replayed under the other provider still names the one it used.
- **`Discovery` reuses the graph's own models.** `DiscoveredNode`
  *inherits* `services.graph.Node`, adding only `discovered: Literal[True]`
  and `idx` — the number the model knows the paper by (`None` tolerated
  for saved sessions from the era when lecture backfills discovered
  un-numbered papers). Because `extra="forbid"` is inherited, an agent-found
  paper is guaranteed to have exactly the shape `build_graph` produces:
  the frontend merges both into one canvas and can't tell the difference,
  and a drifted node shape fails loudly at the event boundary instead of
  rendering a half-empty node. Edges are `services.graph.Edge`, unchanged.
- **Each workflow's legal event sequence** (its "event grammar") is spelled
  out in its `skills/workflows/` playbook — e.g. the lecture's
  `Beat+ Done | Error`.
- **Two wire renames from the old protocol** (frontend adapts in Phase 6):
  the old `nodes` SSE event is now `discovery` (a `Discovery` model
  emitting an event called "nodes" read wrong), and `Error` carries
  `message` (the old event named "error" with a field named "error"
  stuttered).

## `traversal.py` — day-cached, provider-aware hops and search

The shared plumbing under every "bring in a paper that isn't on screen"
move: `neighbors(paper_id, relation, limit, provider)` pulls one hop of
references / citations / similar work, `search(query, limit, year_from,
year_to, provider)` runs a free-text search, and both cache their results for
`config.graph.cache_ttl` (the same day-long TTL as a graph snapshot —
citation data changes slowly).

**Both follow the selected graph provider** (v5.2.0), so an OpenAlex graph
expands/searches OpenAlex — keeping the pulled-in nodes in the same id space as
the graph. Under S2 a `similar` hop is SPECTER2 recommendations; under OpenAlex
it's `related_works` (concept/citation overlap — weaker, but the closest
analogue, since OpenAlex has no embeddings). The OpenAlex hop first resolves the
node id (a `DOI:`/`ARXIV:`/`W…` id) to a work, then hits `cited_by:` /
`cites:` / `related_works`. Provider is part of the cache key.

One consumer today:

- **The researcher's `expand_node`** wraps `neighbors`, and **the paper
  scout's `search` / `more_like`** wrap `search` and the `similar` hop of
  `neighbors` — adding everything agentic on top: budgets, visited-sets,
  numbering the finds, building `Discovery` events. Note the two callers of
  the *same* `similar` hop, doing different things with it: the researcher
  draws it on the graph, the scout treats it as a second way to search and
  hands back plain papers. The provider comes from the graph the question is
  grounded in — threaded `route → researcher.answer → ResearcherDeps.provider
  → the tools → papers.scout`. (The lecture backfill walks that also used to
  loop over `neighbors` are gone — lectures never expand the graph.)

Design points worth knowing:

- **The cache is the point.** The researcher re-hits the same hops
  constantly within a session (re-expansions across follow-up questions),
  and the rate-limited APIs must not pay for each repeat. This is the
  *cached, agent-tuned* layer over the `integrations` traversal clients —
  the deliberate name-cousins that talk to the live API and cache nothing.
- **Limits are explicit arguments, and part of the cache key.** The old
  `AGENT_*_LIMIT` globals died in the Phase-1 config purge; each caller's
  own config supplies its limit, and a hop cached at one limit is never
  reused for another.
- **`Relation` is a `Literal`** (`"references" | "citations" | "similar"`)
  and `REL_TAG` maps it to the `Edge.type` tag — so when the researcher builds
  `Edge(type=REL_TAG[relation])`, mypy verifies the whole chain from tool
  argument to graph edge. **`CitationHop` is the narrower one** (`"references"
  | "citations"`) that `expand_node` takes, and that narrowing IS the v7.5.0
  rule: a similar-hop expansion isn't refused at runtime, it can't be asked
  for, because the tool schema the model sees offers two values. `similar`
  stays in `Relation` for the paper scout, which hops the same data as a
  second way to search.
- **Plumbing, not tools.** No model ever calls these directly (see the
  layout rules below), and `S2Error` propagates uncaught — deciding what a
  failed hop means (skip the ancestor, tell the model, spend no budget) is
  the callers' job, not the plumbing's.

## `factory.py` — config entries → live model objects

Each sub-agent's `main.py` calls `factory.model_for(<its AGENT_ID>)` to get
the model its `config.llm.agents` entry names, and passes it **to the run**
— `agent.run(..., model=...)`, not `Agent(model)`. This is the one place
credentials meet PydanticAI —
and it's deliberate that the entry's `"provider:model"` string is only ever
*parsed* here, never passed to PydanticAI whole: the bare string shorthand
would pull the API key from environment variables, and this app's config
rule is no env vars — the key comes from `config.llm.providers`, passed
explicitly to the provider. `agent_entry(id)` (the lookup half) is also how
an agent reads its own `extras` knobs — which arrive **already validated**
against that agent's model in `config.AGENT_EXTRAS`, complete with defaults
filled in, so a package indexes them (`extras["min_beats"]`) instead of
range-checking or `.get`-defaulting them.

**This module is the entire vendor seam** (since v7.13.0). `build_model`
matches on the entry's provider prefix and constructs the matching PydanticAI
pair — `anthropic`, `openai` (whose `base_url` also covers every
OpenAI-compatible server), `google`, `ollama` — so teaching Curious Astronaut a new vendor
is one case arm plus a config block, and no agent package changes. The
`openai` arm is the one that picks between two wire APIs (since v7.28.1): a
blank `base_url` is OpenAI proper and gets the **Responses** API, because
OpenAI's current models reason by default and its older chat-completions
endpoint refuses function tools while reasoning is on — and every agent here
is function tools, structured output included (the live symptom was
`Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported for gpt-5.6-… in
/v1/chat/completions`). Responses is also where OpenAI's provider-side web
search lives. A custom `base_url` is a Groq/OpenRouter/LM-Studio-style
compatible server, and those speak chat-completions — few implement Responses
at all — so they keep the chat model. Two consequences worth holding onto:

- **Vendors are per agent, not global.** Each `config.llm.agents` entry names
  its own, so running the lecturer on a free local model while the web scout
  stays on one that can actually search the web is a normal setup. The
  companion `supports_web_search(agent_id)` exists for exactly that — the web
  scout asks it **per run** and attaches the provider-side search capability
  only when the vendor has one (Ollama does not).
- **A blank vendor fails at request time, not at import.** `build_model`
  raises a `ValueError` naming the vendors that *are* configured, rather than
  letting config validation refuse to boot — the keyless graph explorer must
  survive a machine with no LLM set up at all.

**Nothing is built at import (since v7.14.0), and that is the whole point.**
Until then each package ran `Agent(factory.build_model(AGENT_ID), ...)` at
module level, which quietly cost two things the rest of the codebase does not
pay. Importing the app *constructed a provider*, so a blank vendor block took
`create_app` down with it and the "keyless graph explorer" promise was false
on exactly the machines it was written for. And the model froze at boot while
`config.reload_config` updated everything else in place — so the settings
modal's "no restart" promise held for every setting except the ones the modal
exists to change. `model_for` fixes both by reading config late, which is the
codebase convention the agents were the sole exception to.

It caches, because constructing a model builds an HTTP client and rebuilding
one per run would churn connections. What it caches *against* is a
fingerprint of the config that produced it — the agent's `provider:model`
string plus the named vendor's whole block — so an edited key invalidates the
model just as surely as a switched vendor does. Two threads racing only build
the same model twice, so there is no lock.

The factory also sets `anthropic_eager_input_streaming` on Anthropic models —
see `streams.py` below for why nothing streams without it.

## `streams.py` — consuming a run synchronously, event by event

`drive(agent, ...)` runs `run_stream_events` (async-only) on **one shared,
long-lived event loop** (a daemon thread; request threads reach it via
`run_coroutine_threadsafe`) and yields each event as it arrives, so workflows
stay plain sync generators. It used to open a *fresh* loop per call and close
it at the end — fine sequentially, but the agents (and their one shared
Anthropic client) are singletons, so several streams at once (concurrent
lectures) each ran on their own loop over the one httpx pool, and the first
loop to close surfaced `Event loop is closed` in the others. One persistent
loop fixes it: httpx multiplexes concurrent requests on a single loop safely.
Three hard-won lessons live around it, the streaming two frame-timestamped
against the live API: the sync convenience wrapper
(`run_stream_sync().stream_output()`) delivers structured output in one
burst at the end — drive the raw events instead; and Anthropic buffers a
tool call's input JSON server-side unless the factory sets
`anthropic_eager_input_streaming` — and every structured output IS a tool
call, so without that flag nothing "streams" no matter how you consume it.

## `prompts.py` — app data → model input

The other half of agent assembly: `skill(name)` loads one skill's markdown
from `skills/` (a typo'd skill name fails at import, not by silently
weakening the prompt) — agents pass their parts straight to PydanticAI,
`instructions=[SYSTEM_PROMPT, *(skill(n) for n in SKILLS)]`, which joins a
sequence with blank lines natively. `node_lines(nodes)` renders graph nodes
as the numbered list of the `numbered-papers` protocol (a paper's number is
its list position + 1) and `idx_to_id` maps the model's indices back to node
ids, ignoring hallucinated ones (shared by the lecturer and, later, the
researcher). `graph_refs_from_text(nodes, text)` is the clickable-citation
counterpart: it scans finished prose for the `[n]` markers actually *used* and
resolves each against the same numbered list, returning a `{"n": node_id}` map
the frontend turns into clickable chips. A combined marker (`[14, 29]`, which
the model sometimes writes despite the prompt asking for separate `[14][29]`)
contributes each of its indices, so every number stays clickable — the same
split the frontend's `remarkCite` and `resolveRefs` apply. The **lecturer** resolves this
server-side and ships it on each beat's `graph_refs` field — a lecture numbers the
mode-filtered `_story_nodes`, which the frontend never sees, so it *can't*
resolve them itself. The **researcher** is the mirror case: it gets the full,
unfiltered node list, so the frontend resolves its answer's `[n]` markers
directly (grounding order + idx-tagged discoveries) and no backend `graph_refs` is
emitted.

`paper_refs(nodes, text, provider)` is the graph-free sibling — same scan,
same numbering, but it carries title, URL, and **the provider that issued
each id**. That last field is the load-bearing one: a paper id is only
resolvable in the backend that minted it, and the frontend's click *builds a
graph* from it, so a reference that travelled (a dropdown switched
mid-conversation, a session restored under the other backend) needs to say
where it came from or the build looks up an id in a namespace it was never
in. See `frontend/src/teacher/transcript/README.md` for what the click does
with it.

**Library citations work the other way round.** `source_lines(sources)`
numbers the user's uploaded sources (`[S1] "Title"`), `format_passages(hits,
sources)` tags each retrieved passage with the marker to copy (`[S1, p.243]`,
or `[S1]` for a page-less web source), and `source_refs(sources, text)`
resolves those markers back to real ids. Unlike `[n]` paper markers, these
*must* be resolved server-side and streamed (as a `SourceRefs` event): only
the backend knows which of the user's sources a turn retrieved. The map is
keyed by index alone and carries no page — the page is already in the marker
— which is what lets it be emitted *before* the prose, so a marker renders as
a real title the moment it streams instead of showing raw until the answer
lands. Both agents that show library passages use this: the researcher
(`search_sources`) and the lecturer (intuition mode). `history(turns)`
converts the routes layer's `[{role, content}]` turns into PydanticAI
message history.

**Provenance is observed, never asked for.** `Provenance` carries what the
server watched happen during a turn — whether a library was in scope, how many
library searches and paper searches ran, how many passages came back, and how
many sources and papers the *finished prose* cites. It does not ask the model
where its knowledge came from, because a model has no reliable access to which
of its sentences came from a retrieved passage and which from its own weights;
the answer would be a confident label with nothing behind it. The one
self-reported field on it is `kind`, and it rides there precisely so the claim
can be checked against the counts beside it. The frontend turns the counts into
one line (`teacher/transcript/provenance.ts`) — deliberately, so the wording is
presentation and can change without touching the agent. Library and paper
searches are counted **separately**: "went to Semantic Scholar and cited none
of it" and "wrote this from memory" are different things to tell a student, and
a single counter made them indistinguishable (see `docs/history.md`, v6.8.0).

One house rule lives here: **agents are built with `instructions=`, never
`system_prompt=`** — PydanticAI silently drops a `system_prompt` whenever
`message_history` is passed, which would cost an agent its persona on every
follow-up turn.

## Decisions log (locked before design)

1. **Hybrid orchestration with intent hints.** Routes always call the
   orchestrator, passing the UI's intent (`lecture` / `research`).
   Known intents dispatch straight to the matching sub-agent per its
   `skills/workflows/` playbook — no routing LLM call. The orchestrator's
   own model engages only when intent is ambiguous or a workflow needs
   multi-step coordination.
2. **API-only.** The claude-CLI backend (subscription streaming) is gone —
   it existed to power tool-free fallbacks, and PydanticAI can't drive it.
   `backends.py` and the before-first-token fallback dance die with it.
3. **The non-agentic grounded Q&A is deleted, not ported.** It was the CLI
   backend's consolation prize. One researcher, always with tools; easy questions
   simply won't trigger tool calls.
4. **Structured outputs everywhere.** Lecture beats stream as typed objects
   (no newline-delimited-JSON parsing); cited papers are a field of the
   answer (no `<<CITED>>` sentinel, no hold-back streaming, no `discard`
   events). The one string protocol that survives is `<<FIG n>>` — a figure
   marker is *positional within prose*, which structured output can't
   express.

### Layout rules

- **The package root *is* the shared directory.** Anything sitting directly
  at the root (`events.py`, `traversal.py`, `skills/`) is shared
  infrastructure available to every agent.
- **Agents sit in two tiers, flat, and no deeper** (v7.0.0).
  `orchestrators/` own an outcome and may delegate; `workers/` each own one
  source and answer a bounded question about it. Which tier something belongs
  in is decided by one rule, kept in
  [`workers/README.md`](workers/README.md) so it isn't re-argued: **a
  capability earns worker status when it needs judgment or context
  isolation — otherwise it stays a plain function.** That file also holds the
  return-shape contract (structured findings, never prose, never indices) and
  why depth beyond two tiers was rejected. Workers are grouped by *kind*
  (`search/` today), so the grouping folder — not the worker — is what sits
  under `workers/`.
- **No router.** Routes call the agent they mean. The `orchestrator`
  package and the `Intent` enum were deleted in v7.0.0; see
  [`orchestrators/README.md`](orchestrators/README.md) for what happened to
  the two things it carried.
- **`tools.py` appears only inside an agent** and only ever means "this
  agent's model-callable tool surface" — functions registered on the
  PydanticAI agent whose signatures become schemas the LLM sees. Shared
  *plumbing* (code tools call into, which no model ever sees) lives at the
  root as ordinary modules; it is never called "tools."
- **Every sub-agent package carries its own `README.md`** documenting its
  workflow, tools, budgets, and events.

### The sub-agent contract

Each sub-agent package is exactly:

- **`main.py`** — the PydanticAI `Agent`: its deps type, output type, and
  construction from the agent's `config.llm.agents` entry (looked up by id).
- **`tools.py`** — tools only *this* agent exposes to its model. Absent when
  the agent has none.
- **`config.py`** — the agent's system prompt, the list of skills it loads
  from `agents/skills/`, and its budget knobs. The central
  `config.llm.agents` entry supplies the model string and tunables; the
  package's `config.py` supplies the words.
- **`README.md`** — the agent's own documentation.

### Skills

A skill is a markdown file in `agents/skills/` holding prompt-ready
instructions. Each sub-agent's `config.py` names the skills it loads; a
shared loader reads them and appends their content to the agent's system
prompt. Two kinds live side by side:

- **Behavior skills** (the files at the `skills/` root: `numbered-papers`,
  `teaching-voice`, `citation-discipline`, `figures`) — reusable
  instruction blocks shared by whichever agents opt in.
- **Workflow skills** (`skills/workflows/`) — the orchestrator's playbooks:
  one per intent, defining inputs, steps, delegation, and the event stream.
  For a known intent the dispatch is deterministic code that *implements*
  the skill; when the orchestrator's model engages, the skills are its
  instructions.

## The workflows

### `orchestrator` *(built)*

The front door. `run(intent, ...)` takes the UI's intent hint + the request
payload, dispatches the matching workflow deterministically, and is the one
place the termination contract is enforced: every stream ends with exactly
one `Done` or `Error`. Lectures are pure delegation — **a lecture never
expands the graph**; every mode narrates the visible node set as-is (the
old backfill walks are gone; only the researcher grows the graph). **No
model lives in the orchestrator yet, deliberately:** every current entry
point passes a known intent, so the hybrid design's model half
(ambiguous/multi-step requests) is a documented seam in `main.py`, not
speculative plumbing — same call as the query-expansion seam in Phase 3.
See its own README.

### `lecturer` — the streamed graph lecture *(built)*

- **Input:** seed, the reader's **scoped** nodes (numbered), a `framing`
  (`summary` | `history`), and an optional target paper. Lectures never expand
  the graph, and the scope is the lecture's subject — passed through untouched
  rather than re-derived. Since v7.17.0 there is no `mode`: the four mode
  buttons that each carved their own slice out of the graph are gone, because
  doing so overrode whatever the reader had filtered or selected. The two
  remaining shapes are read off the request — a target means the bridge
  lecture, a scope of *one paper* (any paper, not just the seed) means the solo
  one, that paper taught in chapters from its full text. **`framing` is the one
  input the scope can't replace**: which papers is the scope's answer, how to
  tell them is the reader's.
- **Tools:** none.
- **Output:** a streamed sequence of typed `Beat` objects
  (`heading`, `text`, `node_indices` → mapped back to node ids) so the
  frontend reveals the story beat-by-beat and lights up graph nodes in sync.
  Structured output replaces the old NDJSON protocol and its fence-stripping
  parser.
- **Skills:** `numbered-papers`, `teaching-voice`, `citation-discipline`.
- **Config:** the four intent paragraphs (summary / history / solo / bridge);
  `extras`
  knobs (typed as `config.LecturerExtras`) for the beat-count bounds
  (`min_beats`/`max_beats`, default 7–12 — widened as a full-span lever; the
  model enforces min ≤ max). `frontier_window_months` sat here until v7.17.0,
  sizing a lecture that no longer exists.

### `researcher` — agentic Q&A over the graph *(built)*

The flagship. Reads, expands, and searches via tool use, then answers
grounded in what it actually read.

- **Input:** question, seed, visible nodes, conversation history, and optional
  library scope (`source_ids`: `None` = whole library, present list =
  pinned to exactly those, empty list = source search disabled).

  A `lectures` argument used to ride along, carrying every lecture the student
  had been shown (`PlayedLecture` beats out of the frontend's transcript cache)
  to be folded into the prompt under a budget, so an answer wouldn't re-derive
  a story they had just watched. It went in **v7.21.0**, and with it
  `agents/models.py` — the module existed only for that pair of types. The
  reason is worth keeping: a lecture used to live *outside* the conversation,
  in a slot the Lecture button wrote, so the only way the researcher could see
  one was to be handed it. A lecture is a chat turn now, so it arrives through
  `history` like every other turn and there is nothing special to assemble.
  That also dissolved a filed ticket about giving lecture context its own
  provenance count: the awkwardness it described — every other count on that
  line is an *observed* tool call, while lecture context was *pushed* into the
  prompt and so uncountable — was an artifact of the push, not of lectures.
- **Tools** (its `tools.py`):
  - `read_paper` — summary (abstract + TL;DR, hydrated from S2 on demand)
    or full text via ar5iv; a full read also lists the paper's figures.
  - `expand_node` — one hop of references or citations for a numbered
    paper; new papers get numbered, and streamed to the graph when they
    attach to a paper already drawn (see "What reaches the canvas"). Citation
    hops only, since v7.5.0 — a citation map is made of citations, and
    embedding-similar work reaches the answer through the paper scout
    instead.
  - `find_papers` — hands a *need* in plain words to the **paper scout**
    (`workers/papers`), which writes and re-writes the queries itself and
    reports back; the researcher numbers whatever it found. Numbered, not
    drawn — the reader promotes a found paper by clicking its citation.
    Replaced the one-shot `search_papers` in v7.0.0: a single query against
    a lexical, citation-weighted search answers "what's new in X" with
    landmarks from a decade ago, and reformulating is a loop with a decision
    in it. It **replaced** rather than joined it — two paths to one source is
    the bug, not the feature.
  - `search_web` — the same shape for the **web scout** (`workers/web`):
    announcements, releases, documentation, benchmarks — where the news
    breaks before the paper does. Registered only when its budget is
    non-zero, which is also the web's off switch.
  - `show_figure` — attach a real ar5iv figure; the model places a
    `<<FIG n>>` marker in its prose where the image belongs.
  - `search_sources` — semantic search over the user's library; registered
    only when a library exists (checked before the embedding model loads).
- **Budgets:** total steps, wall clock, full/summary reads, hops, searches,
  web searches, source searches, figures — from its agents entry. A
  `find_papers`/`search_web` call spends one of *these* and then runs a whole
  scout, which has budgets of its own. Visited-sets, the read
  cache, and remaining budgets live in the run's deps.
- **Output:** streamed answer prose, with `cited` (the papers it read plus
  any it named) as a structured field of the final result.
- **What reaches the canvas** *(v7.3.0)* — **the graph grows only where a new
  paper attaches to a paper already on it.** `find_papers` numbers its hits and
  draws none of them: a topic search links to no specific paper, so they used
  to arrive as edgeless dots floating beside the graph, which was the only way
  to surface them back when a chat citation couldn't hand a paper back. It can
  now (v6.11.0, provider-stamped in v6.14.0), so the reader promotes a found
  paper deliberately by clicking `[n]`. The same rule covers the case that
  makes it *one* rule rather than a quirk of one tool: expanding a paper that
  isn't itself drawn produces edges pointing at a node the frontend hasn't got,
  and a link with a missing endpoint makes d3-force raise and takes the graph
  down — so that expansion numbers its neighbours and draws nothing either.
  Run in the other direction, an expansion that turns up an already-numbered
  but undrawn paper **promotes** it: the edge it was missing now exists.
  `ResearcherDeps.on_canvas` is the bookkeeping; `tools._canvas_growth` is the
  rule. **v7.5.0 finished the thought**: `expand_node` takes a `CitationHop`,
  so the graph grows only along citations — and the two relations that could
  no longer arrive, `search` and `similar`, were removed outright rather than
  kept for old saves (there were none). `primaryRel` is total instead, drawing
  any relation this build has no meaning for as grey `unknown`.
- **Events:** `Trace` (each tool step, including `search_web`), `Discovery`
  (nodes/edges to merge into the live graph), `Figure`, `Token`, `Cited`,
  `Provenance` (which now counts web searches and pages separately from
  paper searches — "went to the literature" and "went to the web" are
  different claims about an answer's footing).
- **Skills:** `numbered-papers`, `teaching-voice`, `citation-discipline`,
  `figures`.

### `query_analyst` — *(retired v7.6.0)*

> A one-shot micro-agent that expanded a seed-search query ("DQN" → "DQN deep
> Q-network deep Q-learning") and named papers it confidently recalled, which
> `live_search` then verified by title match. Both halves outlived it in a
> better form: the **paper scout** reformulates across several attempts rather
> than expanding once (it can see what came back), and its `match_title` tool
> resolves a recalled title directly. Keeping the analyst would have left two
> implementations of "search papers" — the duplication the worker split exists
> to prevent. See `docs/history.md`.

## Who uses it, and how/why

Callers *into* the package (each sub-agent's own README traces its callers
in detail):

- **`routes/search.py`** — calls the **paper scout** directly (v7.6.0), with
  no orchestrator and no researcher above it: direct search is the same
  worker the researcher sends out, run alone. The only agent consumed outside
  a teacher workflow, and it reaches `services/search` rather than the other
  way round — the scout reads the snapshot cache from inside its own `search`
  tool.
- **The routes layer (Phase 5, traced from the old repo, not yet ported).**
  Old `routes/teacher.py` calls the teacher functions directly —
  `lecture_beats` behind `POST /api/teacher` (lecture), `answer_agentic`
  behind the Q&A path, `answer_from_sources` behind `POST /api/ask_sources` —
  and serializes their `("kind", data)` tuples as SSE frames. The rewrite
  replaces all of that with one entry point: routes call the
  **orchestrator** with an intent hint (`lecture` / `research`),
  serialize the typed `Event` stream by its `type` tag, and keep session
  history persistence for themselves (a locked decision — agents receive
  history, they never store it).

Inside the package, the shared root modules exist for the sub-agents:
every agent builds its model via `factory.model_for` and its instruction
parts via `prompts.skill`; the researcher converts route
turns with `prompts.history`; the lecturer (and next the researcher) numbers
papers with `prompts.node_lines` / `idx_to_id`; every workflow yields
`events` models; `traversal.py` serves the researcher's expand/search tools.

## Testing

Agent loops are tested with PydanticAI's `TestModel` / `FunctionModel`
(scripted model behavior, no network) — replacing the old `fake_claude`
fixture built from raw Anthropic SDK events. Deterministic pieces
(`traversal.py`, skill loading, event models) get plain unit tests. As
everywhere in this repo: no live API calls, ever.
