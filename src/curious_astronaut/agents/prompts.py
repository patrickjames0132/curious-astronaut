Description:
Turns app data into model input, shared by every sub-agent: skill loading,
retrieved passages rendered for a prompt, and route-layer conversation turns
converted to PydanticAI message history.

Agents combine their prompt parts natively — ``instructions=[SYSTEM_PROMPT,
*(skill(name) for name in SKILLS)]`` — since PydanticAI accepts a sequence and
joins it with blank lines itself; this module only supplies the parts.

(Named ``prompts`` rather than ``skills`` — that name belongs to the
``skills/`` directory this module reads from.)
