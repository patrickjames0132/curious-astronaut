Description:
The typed event stream every agent workflow emits.

A workflow (a lecture, a Q&A turn, a library chat) doesn't return one value —
it *streams*: narration arrives beat by beat, an agent's tool steps surface as
they happen, discovered papers merge into the live graph mid-answer. This
module defines that stream's vocabulary as Pydantic models, replacing the old
teacher's ad-hoc ``("kind", data)`` tuples, so every payload shape is declared,
validated, and greppable in one place.

Two discriminated unions tie it together:

* ``Trace`` — the "watch the agent work" events, discriminated by ``action``
  (one variant per thing an agent can do: read, expand, search, ...).
* ``Event`` — everything a workflow may yield, discriminated by ``type``.
  The routes layer (Phase 5) serializes each event as an SSE frame named by
  its ``type``; the frontend switches on the same tag.

``Discovery`` reuses the graph's own ``Node``/``Edge`` models (via
``DiscoveredNode``) so a paper an agent finds mid-answer has exactly the same
shape as one ``build_graph`` produced — the frontend merges them into one
canvas and can't tell the difference.
