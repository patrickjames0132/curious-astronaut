Description:
Day-cached, provider-aware traversal for agent workflows: one hop of
references / citations / similar work, and a free-text paper search.

This is the cached, agent-tuned layer over the ``integrations`` traversal
clients (which talk to the live API and cache nothing) — same name, different
job, and the cache is the point: the researcher's ``expand_node`` /
``find_papers`` tools re-hit the same hops constantly within a session, and
the rate-limited APIs must not pay for each repeat. Results are cached for
``config.graph.cache_ttl`` (the same day-long TTL as a graph snapshot).

Both hops and search follow the **selected graph provider** (v5.2.0), so an
OpenAlex graph expands/searches OpenAlex — not S2 — keeping the pulled-in nodes
in the same id space as the graph. Under S2, ``similar`` is SPECTER2
recommendations; under OpenAlex it's ``related_works`` (concept/citation
overlap — weaker, but the closest analogue).

Plumbing, not tools: no model ever calls these directly. The researcher's tools
wrap them with budgets, visited-sets, and numbering.
