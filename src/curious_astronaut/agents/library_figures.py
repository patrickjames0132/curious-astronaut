Description:
The shared heart of the two ``show_source_figure`` tools.

The researcher's graph Q&A and its graph-free chat both
let the model attach a figure from the user's uploaded PDFs, addressed the
way passages are cited: source + page. Everything past each agent's own
budget checks is identical — resolve the address against the mined manifest
(``services.sources.figures``), dedupe repeats onto their existing marker,
assign the next ``<<FIG n>>`` slot, emit the ``FigureTrace``/``Figure``
events — so it lives here once, against a small structural protocol both
deps classes already satisfy.
