Description:
The web scout: the worker that owns the open web as a source.

**This is a grounded source, not recall.** The distinction matters enough to
write down, because a future reader will find v6.8.0 cutting the
"general-assistant" ambition and reasonably wonder whether this reopens it. It
does not. What was cut there was the model answering from its own weights,
with a soft prompt rule behind it and no way to measure the result. A web page
is as real, as citable and as retrievable as a paper or a page of the reader's
own book — it *extends* the grounding boundary rather than abandoning it, and
every claim still comes back with somewhere to check it.

Both membership criteria are met unambiguously (see ``workers/README.md``):
it needs judgment — phrasing the query, deciding when it has enough — and it
needs context isolation, because raw pages are long and low-signal and would
crowd out the researcher's own context.

The search itself is a provider-side capability, so the retrieval runs on the
vendor's infrastructure and ``max_uses`` enforces the budget for us.

**Not every vendor has one.** A local Ollama model cannot search the web at
all, and since v7.13.0 an agent may be pointed at one. The scout handles that
by refusing to pretend: the capability is only attached when the vendor offers
it, and when it doesn't ``scout`` returns empty *without calling the model*.
That second half is the important one — an agent instructed to search, holding
no search tool, does not fail cleanly; it invents plausible sources. Not
calling it is the only honest degradation available.
