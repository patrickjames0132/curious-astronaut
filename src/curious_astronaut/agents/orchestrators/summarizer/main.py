Description:
The summarizer: a one-shot micro-agent that writes a TL;DR from an abstract.

Semantic Scholar ships its own model-written TLDRs; OpenAlex has no
equivalent, and even S2 lacks one for plenty of papers — so the detail
panel's TL;DR view generates one on demand. **On demand is the contract**:
the agent runs only when the user actually toggles a selected paper to
TL;DR (never during graph builds or panel hydration), and the route layer
caches the result per paper forever, so each paper bills at most once —
see ``routes/graph.py::api_paper_tldr``.

Like the query analyst, failure degrades instead of raising: ``summarize``
returns None on any error (no key, network down, rate limit), and the route
turns that into an honest HTTP error — the abstract is still right there.
