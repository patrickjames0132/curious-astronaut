Description:
The router: decide whether a typed message wants the lecturer or the
researcher, with what framing, and — for a lecture — over which papers.

Two stages, cheapest first. A message that *names* a lecture and points at
nothing in particular (``OBVIOUS_LECTURE`` + ``DEICTIC_TAIL``) is routed on
the spot, with no model involved; anything else goes to a one-shot
classifier. Every failure — no key, network down, rate limit, unparseable
output — lands on the researcher, because that is the cheaper mistake: a
misrouted question wastes a minute of narration, a misrouted lecture wastes
one short answer.

A third, rarer call resolves the papers a message *named* against the graph
(``resolve_papers``). It is separate from ``route`` so the graph's paper list
is only sent, and only billed, for the messages that name one.

    There is no ``confident`` field, unlike its sibling ``PaperName``: a

    the safe one. ``target='answer'`` already *is* "not sure this is a
    lecture", so a third value would only give the caller two ways to spell
    the same decision.

    ``scope`` says which papers, never *which ids*: the classifier reads the
    message alone, and ``named`` is a promise that a second call
    (``resolve_papers``) can turn the message into ids given the graph. Read
    for an ``answer`` exactly as for a ``lecture`` (since v7.24.0): the
    researcher grounds in the scope the same way the lecturer narrates it.

    ``year_from`` / ``year_to`` are a period the message limited the lecture
    to ("between 2016 and 2017", "the 2010s", "the last five years"), applied
    on top of whichever scope it named; both None when it named none. Years
    rather than a sixth scope kind because a period *combines* with the
