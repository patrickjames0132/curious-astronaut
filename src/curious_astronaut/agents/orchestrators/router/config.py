"""Messages that open by naming a lecture: the reader said the word.

The `tail` group — everything after the phrase — decides whether the match
counts, via ``DEICTIC_TAIL`` below. Naming a lecture settles the *target*,
but since v7.23.0 a message also picks the lecture's **scope**, and a tail
with content in it ("…on the references", "…on the Bekenstein paper") is
exactly the part a regex cannot read. So the fast path claims only the
messages whose tail says nothing about *which* papers.

Deliberately **narrow**. Every phrasing here names a lecture outright, so the
match cannot be wrong and the call is pure waste; the tempting additions are
all ambiguous and belong to the model. "Summarize this" is the clearest
example — it means the papers on screen about half the time and *your last
answer* the other half, and only the conversation says which. Same for "walk
me through attention", which is as likely a question about the mechanism as a
request to be taught the papers about it.

So this is a latency shortcut, not the routing rule. Being small is the point:
a fast path that guesses is worse than no fast path, because the model it
skips would have been right."""

"""What may follow a named lecture for the fast path to keep it: nothing, or a
phrase that points at the screen — "these", "this", "the selected papers",
"what I have on screen", "how we got here". Every alternative names *no*
particular paper, so the scope is certainly what is on screen and the routing
is certainly a lecture; there is nothing left for a model to decide.

A tail that says anything else — "the references", "this paper: BERT", "the
attention papers", "transformers" — is a scope, and the model reads it. That
includes tails a keyword pattern *could* read ("the references"), because a
pattern that gets "the references" right and "the papers that reference the

    "what they have on screen — 'the whole graph', 'everything on the map', "
    "'all the papers in this graph', 'the entire graph'. Not for 'these' or "
    "'everything' alone, which mean what is on screen.\n"
