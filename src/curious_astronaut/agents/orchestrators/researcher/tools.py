Description:
The researcher's model-callable tool surface, plus the run-state (deps) the
tools share.

Every tool follows the old runners' one hard rule: **failures are reported in
the tool-result text, never raised** — a spent budget, an invalid index, or a
failed fetch is information the model steers by ("answer now with what
you've gathered"), not an error that kills the answer. Each tool also pushes
typed events (``Trace`` / ``Discovery`` / ``Figure``) onto the deps queue,
which ``main.answer`` drains into the workflow's event stream so the user
watches the agent work live.

Budgets come from ``config.BUDGETS`` (the agent entry's ``extras``): a total
step cap across all tools, plus per-tool budgets. Visited-sets and the read
cache make repeats free instead of wasteful.
