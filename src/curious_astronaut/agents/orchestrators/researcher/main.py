Description:
The researcher: agentic Q&A over the graph — read, expand, search, then answer.

The flagship workflow. The model gets tools (``tools.py``) and a run-state
deps object; it investigates until it has enough, then produces a structured
``Answer`` whose ``text`` streams as it's generated and whose ``cited`` field
replaces the old ``<<CITED>>`` sentinel outright (no hold-back streaming, no
``discard`` events — narration text parts before a tool call are simply
never emitted).

The event bridge is the one piece with real machinery: PydanticAI's
``run_stream_events`` is async-only, so ``answer`` drives it one event at a
time on a private event loop, draining the deps event queue (traces,
discoveries, figures pushed by tools) between run events and decoding the
final answer's streamed tool-call args into ``Token`` deltas via partial
JSON parsing.

    numbered papers came from the provider, so a question about them has
    already consulted the paper source; the library is only ever *listed* in
    the prompt, so having one is not the same as having read it.

    **Reachability is the other half, and it is not optional** (v7.1.0). A

    This is what replaces the librarian's grounding-by-construction. When
    retrieval ran *before* the model, the model could not answer without the
    passages in front of it; as a tool it can simply not call it and answer
    from memory, and the student will reasonably believe the answer came from
    their book. Prompting alone is known to be insufficient here — the agent
    already skips ``show_figure`` when asked outright — so the guard is
    structural: an ``answered`` turn that skipped a source is bounced back for
    another attempt.

    **Coverage, not routing.** Since v7.0.0 this spans every source rather
    than only the library, which is deliberately the answer to "how do we make
    sure it asks all of them?" — an output guard, not a router that decides
    for the model which sources a question needs. The model still chooses the
    order, the phrasing and what to do with the results; it just cannot
    quietly skip one.

    Four deliberate limits. It asks whether a source was **consulted**, not
    whether it *helped*: a search returning nothing satisfies it, or an empty
    library would make every answer unreachable. It counts a source already in
    front of the model as consulted (see ``_unconsulted``), so a question
    about the open graph doesn't have to re-search the literature it came
    from. It demands only what the model can **still reach** — a spent budget
    ends the obligation, because a guard that insists on a refused tool
    deadlocks the run into the usage backstop and the reader gets no answer at
    all (also ``_unconsulted``; v7.1.0). And it only ever fires on
    ``answered`` — a mandatory sweep on every turn is exactly the v6.7.0 bug
    where saying "hi" searched the student's books, and it would now do it
    three times over.

    *run* events, and a tool call produces none until it returns. So a scouting
    run showed the reader an empty panel for however long it took, which reads
    as a hang rather than as work.

    It rides ``PartEndEvent`` — the moment the model finishes writing the
    tool call, which is genuinely before the tool runs. ``FunctionToolCallEvent``
    is the obvious candidate and is **wrong**: it is delivered *after*
    execution, so the pending chip arrived behind the result it was meant to
