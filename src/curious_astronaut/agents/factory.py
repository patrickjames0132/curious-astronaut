Description:
Turns ``config.llm`` entries into live PydanticAI model objects.

Each sub-agent's ``main.py`` calls ``build_model(<its id>)`` to get the model
its ``config.llm.agents`` entry names, and passes it to its ``pydantic_ai.
Agent``. This is the one place credentials meet PydanticAI.

Why not PydanticAI's own ``"anthropic:claude-..."`` string shorthand? Passed
straight to an ``Agent``, that shorthand pulls the API key from environment
variables — and this app's config rule is *no env vars*: every credential
lives in config.json, explicitly. So the provider is constructed by hand with
the key from ``config.llm.providers``, and the ``"provider:model"`` string is
only ever *parsed*, never handed to PydanticAI whole.

**This module is the whole vendor seam.** Every agent gets its model from
``build_model``, so teaching Curious Astronaut a new vendor is a case arm here plus a
config block — no agent package changes. Vendors are per *agent*, not global:
``config.llm.agents`` carries one model string each, so a perfectly sensible
setup runs the lecturer on a free local model and leaves the web scout on a
vendor that can actually search the web (see ``supports_web_search``).
