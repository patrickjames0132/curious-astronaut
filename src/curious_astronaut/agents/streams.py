Description:
Shared plumbing for consuming a PydanticAI run synchronously, one event
at a time.

``run_stream_events`` is async-only, but every workflow here is a sync
generator (Flask streams them as SSE). ``drive`` bridges the gap: it runs
the stream on a shared background event loop and yields each event as it
arrives — the caller stays a plain generator, and tool events / output deltas
flow out live.

This is the bridge the researcher was built on, promoted to a shared module when
the lecturer needed it too: the sync convenience wrapper
(``run_stream_sync().stream_output()``) turned out to deliver structured
output in one burst at the end against the live API — narration "streamed"
all at once. Driving the raw event stream is what actually streams.

**One persistent loop, not a fresh one per call.** The agents (and their one
shared Anthropic ``AsyncClient``) are module-level singletons, but an earlier
``drive`` opened a *new* event loop per call and closed it at the end. Under
concurrency — several lectures playing at once, each on its own Flask thread and
so its own loop — every call reused the single httpx connection pool, which
binds to the first loop that touches it; the first loop to close then tore the
pool out from under the still-running streams, surfacing as ``Event loop is
closed``. Running everything on one long-lived loop (reached from any request
thread via ``run_coroutine_threadsafe``) fixes it: httpx multiplexes concurrent
requests on a single loop safely.
