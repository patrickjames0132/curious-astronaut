Description:
Graph & paper routes: the neighborhood graph for a seed, single-paper
detail hydration, and a paper's figures (proxied from ar5iv).

GET /api/graph?seed=&refresh=      -> neighborhood graph for a seed paper
GET /api/graph/stream?seed=&refresh= -> same, as SSE with coarse build progress
GET /api/paper/<arxiv_id>          -> full details for one paper (panel hydrate)
POST /api/paper/tldr               -> generate (or recall) a paper's TL;DR
GET /api/paper/<ref>/figures       -> figures + captions (ar5iv, else mined OA PDF)
GET /api/paper/<arxiv_id>/code     -> code & artifact links (Hugging Face Papers)
GET /api/paper/<arxiv_id>/categories -> the paper's own arXiv category tags
GET /api/pdf_figure/<token>/<n>    -> one mined PDF float, rendered to PNG
GET /api/figure_proxy?src=         -> same-origin proxy for an ar5iv image

Two failure philosophies live here, on purpose: the *load-bearing* endpoints
(graph, paper) map failures to real HTTP errors (400/404/502), while the
panel *niceties* (figures, code) degrade to ``available: false`` — a missing
figure strip must never 500 the whole detail panel.

    The image URLs ``api_figures`` (and the researcher's ``show_figure``)
    hand the browser point here. Tokens are minted server-side when a PDF is
    mined — an unknown token resolves to no URL and 404s, which is what keeps
    this from being an open proxy (the browser never supplies a URL).

    Args:
        token: The mined PDF's token (see ``services/pdf``).
        figure_index: 0-based index into that PDF's figure manifest.

    Returns:
        PNG bytes with a day-long cache header; 404 for an unknown
        token/index or when the PDF can't be re-fetched/rendered.
