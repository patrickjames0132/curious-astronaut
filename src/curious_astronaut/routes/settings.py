Description:
Read and write the app's settings — the settings modal's backend.

The modal is a **config-file editor**: it displays the active config file's
values and writes edits back to that same file, so the file stays the single
source of truth (hand-edits and modal edits are the same thing). Endpoints:

* ``GET  /api/settings`` — the active config file's path and parsed
  contents. A missing default ``config.json`` is created from the example on
  first load, so there is always a real, writable file.
* ``PUT  /api/settings`` — replace the file's contents. The body is validated
  as a complete ``Config`` **before** anything is written; on success the
  file is rewritten (keys in the template's canonical order, so saves are
  stable and diffs stay readable) and the running app's shared ``config``
  object is updated in place (``reload_config``) — no restart. On failure
  nothing changes and the 400 body carries a per-field error list
  (``{"error": <summary>, "fields": [{"path", "message"}]}``), so the modal
  can show exactly which setting is wrong without dumping raw Pydantic text.
* ``PUT  /api/settings/location`` — repoint the app at a different config
  file (the modal's "config file location" setting, persisted in the
  ``.config-location`` sidecar). The target must exist and validate before
  the sidecar is written; an empty path clears the sidecar, returning to
  the default ``config.json``.
* ``POST /api/settings/drop_cache`` — empty the derived-data cache (graph
  snapshots, search results, paper hydration). Safe by construction: every
  entry can be refetched, and saved sessions live in a different store
  entirely.
* ``GET  /api/settings/models`` — the model ids the configured credentials
  can see, fetched live from **every** vendor (each one's own listing API),
  filtered to the families that could actually run an agent, so the modal's
  agent-model fields can *suggest* rather than leave the reader guessing.
  Suggestions only: the field is a combobox, anything can be typed into it,
  and a listing is never treated as proof a model works — see
  ``KNOWN_MODELS`` for why neither is negotiable. Falls back to the curated
  names when a vendor can't be reached, which costs freshness and nothing
  else.
* ``POST /api/settings/pick`` — open the **native** file chooser on the
  machine running the server and return the chosen path. Exists because a
  browser's own file picker never reveals an absolute path (sandboxing), and
  the sidecar needs one; the server and the browser are the same machine in
  this app's model, so the OS dialog is the honest picker.

The raw file JSON (not ``model_dump``) is what GET returns and PUT accepts,
so values round-trip byte-for-byte and the modal never has to understand
Pydantic's serialized forms.
