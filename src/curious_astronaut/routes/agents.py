Description:
AI-teacher routes: one endpoint per agent, each streaming typed events.

POST /api/route        -> which assistant a typed message wants (JSON, not SSE)
POST /api/route/papers -> which graph papers a lecture request named (JSON)
POST /api/lecture      -> streamed AI lecture over the visible graph
POST /api/ask          -> the research agent, streamed over the visible graph
POST /api/ask_sources  -> streamed chat with no graph open (library + search)

Each endpoint validates the request, builds typed inputs, and hands off to
the agent that serves it; the typed event stream comes back as SSE
frames named by each event's ``type`` tag (``model_dump`` minus the tag),
always terminated by ``done`` or ``error``. The client owns the persisted
transcript and sends completed history on every request. Agents receive
history; neither agents nor routes maintain a competing copy.

(This module is ``routes/agents.py``, the route face of the ``agents``
package — a deliberate name-cousin, different full paths.)
