Description:
Exploration routes: save the conversation (plus a reference to whichever
graph was open) as the reader works, and reopen it later.

GET   /api/sessions            -> list saved explorations (metadata only)
POST  /api/sessions            -> save an exploration (new, or overwrite by id)
GET   /api/sessions/<id>       -> full exploration to restore
PATCH /api/sessions/<id>       -> rename an exploration
DEL   /api/sessions/<id>       -> delete an exploration
POST  /api/sessions/title      -> name an exploration after its conversation

    This is the autosave's endpoint: the frontend re-POSTs the same ``id`` on
    every settled event, so the common case is an overwrite, not a create.

    Body:
        The frontend's exploration blob — ``{name, seed, graph_ref, layout,
        discovered_nodes, discovered_edges, chat, lectures, activeMode}``,
        plus an optional ``id``. A body with an ``id`` overwrites that
        exploration; without one, a new one is created. The blob is
        deliberately unvalidated — it's frontend-owned, and the store treats
        it as opaque.

        **A graphless body is valid and must stay that way.** Since the
        landing chat became the front door a reader can hold a long
        conversation before any graph exists, and refusing to store it is
        exactly the data loss the autosave was built to end. This route used
        to 400 on an empty ``nodes`` list, which made that conversation
        unsavable.

    Returns:
        The stored metadata row as JSON on success; ``{error}`` with HTTP 400
        when the body isn't a JSON object, or 500 when the store fails.

    has to be cheap enough to run all afternoon. The frontend calls this once,
