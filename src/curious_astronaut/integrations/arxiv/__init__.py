Description:
Everything the app derives directly from arXiv itself.

Four things live here, all arXiv-specific and all for arXiv papers only:

* **arXiv-id detection** (``ID_RE``, at the package root below) — recognizing a
  bare or URL-wrapped arXiv id, so a pasted id/link routes to that exact paper
  instead of a keyword hunt.
* **ar5iv rendering** — a paper's figures + full body text, extracted from
  ar5iv (https://ar5iv.org, arXiv's LaTeX→HTML renderer):
  * ``client``   — the shared HTTP fetch (``fetch_html``), the image-proxy
    fetch + host allowlist (``fetch_image`` / ``is_ar5iv_url``), and the cache
    TTL.
  * ``figures``  — ``{image, caption}`` pairs from the render's ``<figure>``s.
  * ``fulltext`` — the render stripped to readable body text; also
    ``html_to_text``, a generic helper reused by the web-page source ingester.
* **the arXiv category taxonomy** (``vocab`` — ``name_for`` over the bundled
  ``taxonomy.json``): the ~155 arXiv category codes, for labelling an arXiv
  paper's own tags. S2's parallel vocabulary is ``semantic_scholar.vocab``.
* **per-id metadata from arXiv's export API** (``categories`` —
  ``get_categories`` / ``get_title``): S2 doesn't carry a paper's arXiv category
  codes, so this hits arXiv's export API (a different host from ar5iv) for the
  tags (labelled via ``vocab.name_for``); the same fetch also serves
  ``get_title``, the title-search fallback for OpenAlex seed resolution.

This package was ``ar5iv`` until we consolidated all arXiv-derived code into one
place (2026-07-05): the ar5iv renderer plus ``ID_RE``, which used to sit in the
separate ``arxiv_client`` package. That package (arXiv *search*) was retired in
favour of Semantic Scholar search and deleted, along with the PyPI ``arxiv``
dependency it was the only user of — so ``ID_RE`` moved here rather than
disappearing with it.

    must be prefixed ``ARXIV:``), so callers sniff which one they're holding.
