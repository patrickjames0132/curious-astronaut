Description:
Thin wrapper over the official ``huggingface_hub`` client for one call.

We only need ``HfApi.paper_info(arxiv_id)`` — HF's ``/api/papers/{id}`` endpoint
wrapped in a typed ``PaperInfo`` (linked models/datasets/Spaces, their totals,
upvotes, GitHub repo). The library owns the HTTP, retries, and user-agent, so
this module is just: hold one ``HfApi`` instance, and translate a 404 into a
"no such paper" miss (None) the way ``code_links`` expects.

``huggingface_hub`` is already in the dependency tree via ``sentence-transformers``;
we depend on it explicitly rather than leaning on that transitively.
