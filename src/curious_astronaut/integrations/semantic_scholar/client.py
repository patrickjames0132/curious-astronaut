Description:
HTTP transport for Semantic Scholar: throttling, retries, and the one
error type this whole package raises.

Rate-limit strategy (learned from a spike against the live API):
  * An optional ``S2_API_KEY`` (sent as ``x-api-key``) lifts the limits.
  * 429s are retried with exponential backoff.
  * Every call is paced to at most one per ``s2.min_interval`` — serialized
    across threads via a lock, since graph building and agent expansion can
    burst concurrently, and even an authenticated key gets ~1 req/sec on
    the graph endpoints.

Nothing here uses a third-party HTTP dependency — stdlib ``urllib`` keeps
the client tiny and the deploy simple.
