# `integrations.semantic_scholar`

The one place in the entire app that talks to Semantic Scholar. Every paper
title, abstract, citation relationship, and similarity score the app ever
shows comes through this package.

## Why it exists

Curious Astronaut's core design bet is to **never store a paper corpus**. There's
no local database of "all papers" — instead, every time you explore a
paper, the app asks Semantic Scholar live: "what does this cite, what cites
it, what's similar to it?" and draws the graph from the answer. Without
this package, there is no graph — it's the thing that turns a seed paper
into an explorable neighborhood.

## How it's structured

```
client.py     — talks to S2 over HTTP: throttling, 429 retries, the S2Error type
     ↓
nodes.py      — translates S2's raw JSON into the app's own "node" shape
     ↓                (id, title, abstract, year, citation count, url, ...)
traversal.py  — get_papers/get_paper, references, citations, recommendations
search.py     — search_papers (free-text, no source paper needed)
corpus/       — the offline S2 citations corpus (bulk Datasets releases → local
                Parquet); its citation_relations is preferred over traversal's
                recency-biased live one when a corpus is ingested
```

A package (not a flat module) split by concern, four files instead of one
~400-line file:

- **`client.py`** — the plumbing: build the HTTP request, throttle it, retry
  on 429 with exponential backoff, raise `S2Error` for anything else that
  fails. Nothing here uses a third-party HTTP dependency — stdlib
  `urllib` keeps the client tiny.
- **`nodes.py`** — the translator: `node()` is the *single* place a raw S2
  paper object becomes the app's own dict shape. Every downstream consumer
  (graph canvas, teacher, frontend detail panel) agrees on one shape
  because they all ultimately get it from here, regardless of which S2
  endpoint produced the raw data. Also holds `from_papers()`, a small
  shared helper (list of raw papers → `[{"node": ...}, ...]`, skipping
  unresolved entries) used by both `recommendations()` and `search_papers()`
  — they had identical loops before this was factored out.
- **`traversal.py`** — "what's connected to this paper?": `references()`
  (blue nodes — what it cites), `citation_relations()` (splits citers into
  **landmark** green nodes and **latest** light-green nodes — the citation path
  **when the S2 provider is selected**, see the citations section below),
  `citations()` (the single-relation landmark view for on-demand graph
  expansion), `recommendations()` (SPECTER2 embedding similarity — now used
  **only** by the researcher's `expand_node`; the seed-graph *Similar* relation
  was retired in v5.0.0), plus `get_papers()`/`get_paper()` to hydrate full
  details for known ids.
- **`search.py`** — "search all of S2 for X," with no source paper at all.
  Exists specifically because citation/similarity traversal is
  *lineage-biased*: a brand-new paper citing a 2017 seed has no citations
  of its own yet, so no amount of hopping from the seed will ever surface
  it. Free-text search is the only way to reach that kind of paper.

`__init__.py` re-exports the full public API (`S2Error`, `get_papers`,
`get_paper`, `references`, `citations`, `citation_relations`,
`recommendations`, `search_papers`),
so `from ..integrations import semantic_scholar as s2` and `s2.get_papers(...)`
work exactly as if this were still one file — nothing importing this
package needs to know it's a package internally.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **The throttle is a global, process-wide lock — not per-call, not
  per-feature.** `client.py`'s `_throttle_lock`/`_last_request` are module
  state shared by every caller (graph build and agent expansion can fire
  concurrently). There's only one S2 rate-limit budget to protect, no
  matter how many features are hitting it at once, so the throttle has to
  be global.
- **Batch over single-fetch.** `get_papers()` always uses `POST
  /paper/batch` (chunked at 500 ids, S2's cap), never the single-paper GET
  — which 429s almost immediately for unauthenticated callers.
- **Retry only on 429; fail fast on everything else.** Any other HTTP
  error or network failure raises `S2Error` immediately — the one
  exception type this whole package raises, which routes (once ported)
  catch and turn into an HTTP 502.
- **Underscore-prefixed names are genuinely single-file-private.**
  `_neighbors`, `_year_range`, `_BATCH_MAX` are each used by exactly one
  file. Everything called *across* the package's own submodules
  (`throttle`, `headers`, `request`, `quote`, `node`) has no underscore —
  splitting a file into a package changes what counts as "private."
- **No single-letter variables.** `paper` not `p`, `exc` not `e`,
  `http_request`/`response` not `req`/`resp`, `year_from`/`year_to` not
  `lo`/`hi`.

## Citations: landmark vs latest (the S2 provider's citation path)

> **Since v5.0.0 a graph is built from one provider.** When the user picks
> **Semantic Scholar** in the header dropdown, `citation_relations()` is the
> **primary** citation path (not a fallback). It carries a known interim
> limitation — the reachable-pool recency bias below — that OpenAlex avoids with
> server-sorted `cites:` queries and that the offline S2 **citations corpus**

A seed's citers are split into **two disjoint relations** by
`citation_relations()`, both built from **one paged citer fetch**
(`_fetch_reachable_pool`) — and the split's *shape* depends on whether that
fetch reached the end of the citation list (since v5.13.0):

- **Complete pool** — the list ended before the offset ceiling (most seeds; the
  verdict is S2's own `next` flag, not a page-length heuristic). The pool is the
  seed's *whole* citation history, so it ships the **corpus shape**
  (`_complete_pool_relations`): landmarks are a citation-ranked **prefix** sized
  by the STOP rule (`landmark_budget` — the same `budget.computed_cite_limit`
  the corpus and OpenAlex run), and Latest is **per-year bands** from the tau
  `band_start` rule up to the current year. The truncation caveats below simply
  don't apply to these seeds.
- **Truncated pool** — the ceiling cut the list off (a hyper-cited seed):
  - **latest** (light-green nodes) — citers published within the rolling last
    `_LATEST_WINDOW_MONTHS` (12) months, by `pub_date`, newest-first.
  - **landmark** (green nodes) — everything else, the most-cited *historic*
    citers. Chosen by the injected `landmark_select` rule (below), falling back
    to a flat `UNBOUNDED_LANDMARK_CAP` prefix (the shared payload guard from
    `integrations/caps.py`).

**When S2 gives no `publicationDate`, `year` decides** (`_is_latest`). A citer
from a year *after* the cutoff's year is in the window whatever month it came
out; only the cutoff's own year is ambiguous (January is outside, December
inside) and stays a landmark — a landmark misfiled as frontier is the worse
error. Without this, a **2026** citer with no date got filed as a *historic*
landmark, which is nonsense for a paper months old; those then shared one x (no
month → the year's gridline) and drew a bare vertical line at the graph's right
edge whenever the Latest chip was off. OpenAlex hit the same trap and answered it
harder — it splits by year outright, its dating being coarser still. The `latest`
sort key gets the same fallback (`_latest_order`: a year-only citer sorts as Jan 1
of its year, exactly where the timeline draws it), so the reveal order and the
on-screen order agree.

### Choosing the landmark band (`landmark_select` / `landmark_budget`)

`citation_relations` takes two optional rules, one per pool kind, both injected
by `services/graph`'s `build.py` (parameters rather than imports, so
`integrations` stays below `services` in the dependency order; years in,
indices/count out, because the rules only reason about *when* citers were
published — the entries stay here):

- **`LandmarkBudgetFn`** (`budget.computed_cite_limit`) — for a **complete**
  pool: the STOP rule, whose count sizes a citation-ranked prefix. Identical to
  what the corpus and OpenAlex paths run, because a complete pool is the same
  kind of object they hold: a whole-history ranking.
- **`LandmarkSelectFn`** (`budget.select_landmarks`) — for a **truncated**
  pool: a rule handed the *ranked* pool's citer years, answering with the
  **indices** to ship; its pick wins over the flat payload guard.

Both rules rank the citers most-cited first, drop each into a bucket named by
its publication year, and never let a bucket exceed the per-year cap
(`PER_YEAR_CAP` = 12). They differ in **one word** — what happens on a full bucket:

```
ranked citer years:  2020  2020  2020  2019  2018  2020  2017   (cap = 2)

STOP   third 2020 overflows  -> quit the walk       => 2, both in 2020
SKIP   third 2020 is skipped -> carry on walking    => 5, spanning 2017-2020
```

Why the truncated pool must SKIP: a count can only keep a **prefix**, and a
truncated ranking has no honest one. DQN shows it. STOP quits at rank 29 with
the cap on 2020 exhausted, so 2024–2025 — 2155 citers sitting in the pool —
never appear, leaving an 18-month hole before the Latest frontier. SKIP skips
the full years and walks on, shipping 84 (twelve in each of 2019–2025) with no
hole and the same "no year over the cap" guarantee. On a *complete* pool the
argument flips: the prefix of a whole-history ranking is exactly what a Field
Landmark is, tau-banded Latest widens back to meet it, and SKIP-banding would
admit the best of a thin year over the 13th-best of a blockbuster one.

Every term here — landmark, pool, reachable, truncated, label, the two rules — is
defined once, with this same example, in
[`docs/landmark-vocabulary.md`](../../../../docs/landmark-vocabulary.md); the *why*
of predicting vs computing is `services/graph/budget.py`'s module docstring.

### Deep paging

S2 lists citers newest-first, and one page is only 1000 citers. For a heavily-
cited seed that page can span *less than a year*. So the seed build **pages** the
whole reachable list (offsets 0, 1000, 2000, …), stopping only at the list's end
or the `_MAX_OFFSET` ceiling — and reporting **which** of those ended the walk,
since that's the complete/truncated verdict everything above rides on. Graph
expansion (`citations()`) stays one page — it wants the tip, fast.

`_MAX_OFFSET` is **8000**, not 9000: verified live 2026-07-15, S2 400s a page whose
window reaches past ~10k (`offset=9000&limit=1000` fails on two different seeds,
while `offset=8000` serves). So the last servable page starts at 8000 and holds
1000, and the **reachable** pool is exactly 8000 + 1000 = **9000** citers
(`REACHABLE_CITERS`) — everything this path can ever see, however many exist.

**Why it pages the whole list, not just the `latest` window** (v5.5.0). It used to
stop at the first page holding no in-window citer — the window was covered, and the
boundary page's overshoot was meant to seed the landmark "middle band". On a
hyper-cited seed that quietly gutted the landmark relation. Measured live on DQN:
page 1 holds exactly *one* in-window citer and page 2 holds none, so paging stopped
at offset 2000 with a pool covering 2024–2026, and "Field Landmarks" ranked whatever
recent survey sat in the overshoot. The full reachable list runs back to **2019** and
holds Conservative Q-Learning, Decision Transformer, and Dota 2 — six-sevenths of it
was simply never fetched. Paging on leaves `latest` byte-identical (every deeper page
is older than the window) and buys the landmark relation a pool worth ranking. It
costs a slower **cold** build, scaling with the citer list: measured authenticated,
QMIX 4 pages / ~8s and DQN 9 pages / ~15s, against ~3 pages before. Snapshots cache
for a day and the build's progress bar covers the wait.

**Known limit of the *live* S2 path — hyper-cited seeds only:** the offset
ceiling is a hard wall. DQN's 2013–2018 citers — its actual giants (AlphaGo,
A3C, Rainbow) — are unreachable at any page count, so its pool is **truncated**:
a recency slice holding the newest 9000 citers, and the landmark relation is the
most-cited citers *within that slice*, not across the full citation history.
SKIP is exact about the slice, which is not the same as being right about the
paper. Beating that wall was v3.1.0's `_mined_landmarks` (harvest citers'
reference lists, co-citation rank, verify), retired in v4.0.0 when OpenAlex's
sorted `cites:` made it redundant; the corpus is its replacement. A seed *under*
the ceiling has no wall at all — its pool is complete and ships the corpus
shape, which is why the wall is a per-seed caveat, not a path-wide one.

**The fix — the offline citations corpus (`corpus/`).** When a corpus release is
downloaded and ingested (`config.storage.s2_corpus_dir` set, a `CURRENT` release
present), `build.py`'s `_traverse_s2` calls `corpus.citation_relations` **first**
and only falls back to `traversal.citation_relations` (the recency-biased live
path above) when the corpus is absent or can't resolve the seed. The corpus holds
every citation edge with the citers' own counts, so it returns landmark citers
**citation-sorted across all history** — the ranking the live API can't give. See
[`corpus/README.md`](corpus/README.md).

## Relation ordering (what each traversal returns — and the slider walks)

Every relation comes back **already ranked**, by the one key that fits *its*
meaning. The frontend shows a modest prefix and reveals more on demand — the
per-relation count slider walks exactly this order, no re-query — so the
order the backend returns *is* the order the user reveals through:

| Relation | Returned by | Ordered by |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| references | `references()` | citation count — most-cited ancestors first |
| `citation` (landmark) | `citation_relations()` landmark half | citation count — biggest landmarks first |
| `latest` | `citation_relations()` latest half | `pub_date`, newest first |
| similar | `recommendations()` | S2 embedding similarity, as returned |

Each uses **one** key — *popularity* for references/landmarks, *recency* for
`latest`, *similarity* for similar — never a blended score, so "landmark = the
giants" and "latest = the freshest" stay honest. (If landmark order should ever
reward recency too, that's a *velocity* key — `citation_count / age` — a
deliberate swap, not the default.)

## Field lists: three tiers on purpose

`nodes.py` defines what each request asks S2 for: `DETAIL_FIELDS` (one
paper, hydration — abstract/tldr/authors, plus the venue: the normalized
`publicationVenue` record with the legacy `venue` string as fallback, see
`venue_name`), `NEIGHBOR_FIELDS` (the many
nodes of a traversal — summary-light, hydrated lazily on click), and
`SEARCH_FIELDS` = neighbors + `authors.name` (search + title-match hits
render in a pick-a-paper list, where authorship is how humans recognize a
paper; the ~65 anonymous dots of a graph don't need it).

## Who uses it, and how/why

- **`services/graph.py`** — when the graph is built with `provider="s2"`,
  `build_graph()`'s `_traverse_s2` calls one `get_paper()` to hydrate the seed,
  then `references()` + `citation_relations()` for the graph's relations
  (references, landmark citations, latest citations). It **no longer calls
  `recommendations()`** — the *Similar* relation was retired from the build in
  v5.0.0. Also uses `arxiv.looks_arxiv` (from `integrations.arxiv`) to decide
  whether the seed reference needs an `ARXIV:` prefix, or is already a raw S2
  paperId.
- **`agents/traversal.py`** — wraps `references()`/`citations()`/
  `recommendations()`/`search_papers()` behind its own day-long cache (see
  `storage/README.md`) — this *is* the mechanism behind the agentic Q&A
  tools `expand_node` and `search_papers`.
- **`teacher/tools.py`** — calls `get_paper()` to lazily hydrate a neighbor
  node's abstract/tldr on demand, only when the agent's `read_paper` tool
  needs detail that a light-field neighbor node doesn't carry.
- **`routes/graph.py`** — two HTTP entry points: `/api/graph` (via
  `services/graph.py`) and `/api/paper/<id>` (calls `get_paper()` directly
  to hydrate a clicked node's detail panel). Both catch `S2Error` and turn
  it into an HTTP 502 for the frontend.

None of these are ported yet, but because the public API is unchanged,
none of them will need a single import edit when we get there.

## Fields of study — `vocab.py`

S2's **fields of study**: its own ~20 coarse top-level subjects
(`Computer Science`, `Mathematics`, …) — much coarser than arXiv's ~155
categories. This is the vocabulary the **seed-search filter** uses: S2's
`/paper/search` filters on exactly these (`fieldsOfStudy`).

It lives in *this* package because it's S2's vocabulary — each provider owns its
own (arXiv's finer one is `arxiv.vocab`), rather than a shared taxonomy package.

- **`vocab.fields()`** — the fields, alphabetical, for populating the picker.
- **`vocab.valid_fields()`** — a `frozenset` of them, for validating a submitted
  filter.
- Backed by an inline `FIELDS` tuple — a small, fixed, S2-defined list, so no
  data file (unlike arXiv's bundled JSON); each value is already its own
  human-readable label.

**Casing is Title Case** (`"Computer Science"`), matching what S2 returns on
paper objects and accepts in the `fieldsOfStudy` filter. If it ever differs live,
`vocab.FIELDS` is the one tuple to edit. `search.search_papers` forwards a
`fields_of_study` filter straight to `fieldsOfStudy`; its values come from here.

## Testing

Split to mirror the source layout: `test_client.py`, `test_nodes.py`,
`test_traversal.py`, `test_search.py`, and `test_vocab.py` (the ~20 fields in
alphabetical order; `valid_fields()` rejects junk and arXiv codes) — no network
(HTTP is faked at `client.request` or, for `client.py` itself, at
`urllib.request.urlopen`).
