Description:
Query the offline corpus for a seed's citers — the real Field-Landmarks fix.

This is the payoff of the whole pipeline: because the corpus holds *every*
citation edge with the citers' own citation counts, a seed's landmark citers can
finally be returned **citation-sorted across all history** — the ranking S2's
live endpoint never offered (newest-first, and reachable only to the newest 9,000,
so a hyper-cited seed's most-cited citers were simply unreachable).

The seam is :class:`CitationSource`: two methods, ``landmark_citers`` and
``latest_bands``, over an S2 ``corpusid``. The concrete
:class:`DuckDBCitationSource` runs them as DuckDB SQL over the local Parquet; the
long-term Athena-over-S3 implementation is the same SQL against the same schema,
so it drops in behind this Protocol untouched.

``citation_relations`` is the module-level entry point ``build.py`` calls — a
drop-in for the live ``s2.citation_relations`` that returns the same
``(landmark, latest)`` shape, or **None** when the corpus can't serve this seed
(unconfigured, no ingested release, or an unresolvable seed) so the caller falls
back to the live path.

**Since v5.11.0 this path is shaped like the OpenAlex one, not the live one** — a
citation-ranked landmark prefix up to ``landmark_max_year``, then per-year Latest
bands whose start the fitted tau rule places against those landmarks. It used to
mirror the live fallback's rolling 12-month window, on the reasoning that the s2
provider's split should mean the same thing whichever source answered. That
symmetry was the wrong one to keep: the live path is a **recency sliver** and bands
its landmarks because it has no all-history ranking to prefix; the corpus and
OpenAlex both hold whole histories and can place an honest frontier. Two of three
paths now agree, and the odd one out is the one that structurally cannot join them
(a truncated-pool validation study measured why: banded landmarks
flatten the year distribution the tau rule reads, pinning 56 of 58 seeds to a
one-year band). So switching a graph to the corpus changes *which* citers appear —
now the true top-cited across all history — and now also *where the frontier
starts*: per-seed, rather than a flat twelve months.

    A drop-in for the live ``s2.citation_relations`` used by ``build.py`` when the
    offline corpus is available and can resolve the seed. Returns the same
    ``(landmark_entries, latest_entries)`` shape; returns **None** when the corpus
    is unavailable or can't resolve this seed, signalling the caller to use the
    live path.

    Since **v5.11.0 this path is shaped like the OpenAlex one**, which it always
    should have been: it is the only other provider holding a seed's whole citation
    history, and the only one besides OpenAlex that can honestly place a frontier.

    * **Landmarks** — the all-time giants up to ``max_landmark_year``, a
      citation-ranked **prefix** whose length is *computed* rather than predicted.
      With a ``landmark_budget`` rule the ranking runs unlimited and the rule
      measures the real pool; the trained ``cite_budget`` model isn't consulted.
      The unlimited rank is cheap because the query is **two-phase** (see
      :meth:`DuckDBCitationSource.landmark_citers`): the full pool is ranked on
      narrow columns, and the wide display columns are hydrated only for the
      winners the rule keeps.
    * **Latest** — **per-year bands** from ``band_start`` to ``current_year``,
      replacing the flat rolling window this path inherited from the live fallback.
      The band start comes from the fitted tau rule reading the *shipped landmarks'*
      year distribution, so an old seed's frontier widens back to meet its cluster
      instead of stranding a decade of empty timeline.

    **Why the tau rule works here and not on the live path** — it needs a real
    distribution to read, and it gets one precisely *because* landmarks are a
    prefix. The live fallback bands its landmarks (a truncated pool has no
    all-history ranking to prefix), which flattens every year to the cap, which
    collapses tau's ``tau × peak`` threshold and pins the boundary to the newest
    year on 56 of 58 seeds — measured across a 58-seed validation corpus, whose
    verdict this argument carries.

    Args:
        seed_paper: The normalized seed node (its ``arxiv_id`` drives resolution).
        seed_ref: The raw reference the graph was seeded on (a ``CorpusId:`` /
            arXiv id fallback for resolution).
        max_landmark_year: The last landmark-era year — anything newer is banded as
            latest. Passed in rather than computed so both providers split on the
            same boundary (``openalex.landmark_max_year``).
        current_year: The last year to band, inclusive.
        landmark_budget: Optional rule measuring how many of the *ranked* landmark
            pool to ship, from its citer years (see :data:`LandmarkBudgetFn`). Its
            count wins over the payload guard, and its presence makes the query
            unlimited.
        band_start: Optional per-seed band-start chooser (see :data:`BandStartFn`).
            None, or a None answer, keeps the fixed ``number_of_bands`` span.
        number_of_bands: That fixed span's length, in one-year bands below the
            landmark cutoff. None (the default) reads the shared
            :data:`~curious_astronaut.integrations.caps.LATEST_NUMBER_OF_BANDS` at call
            time; the settings modal's non-adaptive mode passes a number to
            override it per request.
        nodes_per_band: The top-N most-cited citers each one-year band keeps.
            None (the default) likewise reads the shared
            :data:`~curious_astronaut.integrations.caps.LATEST_NODES_PER_BAND`.
