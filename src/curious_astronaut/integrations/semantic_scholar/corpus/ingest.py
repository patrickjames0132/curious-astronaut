Description:
Turn the downloaded JSONL.gz shards into queryable Parquet, via DuckDB.

DuckDB does the whole transform — it reads gzipped JSONL and writes Parquet
natively, so there's no pandas/pyarrow step. Two datasets, two layouts, each
chosen for the one query the app runs (a single seed's citers):

* **papers** → ``parquet/papers/clustered_*.parquet``, the whole dataset
  **globally sorted by ``corpusid``**, projected down to the columns the graph
  needs (``corpusid``, the external ids, title, year, date, citation count,
  authors-as-JSON). Shards are first ingested one file each (the incremental
  unit), then a **compaction pass** rewrites them as one clustered dataset —
  global, not per-shard, because every shard spans the whole id range, so
  per-shard sorting leaves every row group covering everything and nothing
  prunes (measured: any corpusid lookup was a full 24.8 GB scan, ~33s; clustered,
  row groups own contiguous id slices and zone maps skip all but a few).
  Plus an **arXiv index** (``parquet/arxiv_index/*.parquet`` — just
  ``arxiv_id → corpusid`` for rows that have an arXiv id) so resolving a seed's
  corpus id is a small sorted lookup, not a 200M-row scan.
* **citations** → ``parquet/citations/bucket=<N>/…``, **hash-partitioned on
  ``citedcorpusid``** (``citedcorpusid % NBUCKETS``). A citer lookup filters to
  one bucket, so it reads ~1/N of the 2.4B-row edge list instead of all of it —
  the local equivalent of the citation-count sort the live API never offered.

Ingest is **idempotent and incremental**: a shard whose Parquet output (or
``_done`` marker, once compaction has folded its file away) already exists is
skipped, so a rerun after an interrupted ingest resumes. Only when a dataset
finishes does the caller flip ``CURRENT`` to this release (see the CLI), so the
app never queries a half-built corpus.

Long citations runs **recycle their worker process** every
:data:`_SHARDS_PER_WORKER` shards: the partitioned write slows down as a
process ages (~3x across the first full release — per *process*, not per
connection, tree, or shard size; see the constant's docs and docs/bugs.md),
so the shard loop runs in a single-worker pool whose child is periodically
replaced, holding every shard near cold-start speed.

    """A DuckDB connection tuned for a bulk single-machine ingest.

    The one setting that matters is ``partitioned_write_max_open_files``.
    DuckDB defaults it to **100**, and a ``PARTITION_BY`` spanning more partitions
    than it can hold open has to close and reopen them as it cycles through — but
    a closed Parquet file can't be appended to, so every reopen starts a **new**
    one. Against :data:`NBUCKETS` = 1024 that turned a single citations shard into
    ~21k files averaging 3.5 KB, nearly all Parquet footer rather than data, on a
    trajectory to ~8M files for the release. File *creation*, not throughput,
    became the bottleneck (measured: ~2.8 min/shard, ~18h projected; merely
    listing the output directory timed out). Holding every bucket open costs one
    file per bucket per shard instead — ~1024, at ~70 KB each.

    Threads and memory are left at DuckDB's own defaults, which it sizes to the
    machine (16 threads / 25 GiB here). They used to be pinned to 8 and 8GB, which
    contradicted this docstring's own intent and made the file explosion *worse* —
    a tighter memory limit forces the partition writers to flush sooner, and every

    compaction. Needs only the parquet root: unlike a re-ingest, the raw shards
