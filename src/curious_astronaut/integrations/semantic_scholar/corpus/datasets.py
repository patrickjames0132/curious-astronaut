Description:
Client for the Semantic Scholar **Datasets** API — the bulk-release index.

Distinct from the Academic Graph client (``..client``): the Datasets API is a
different host, needs the api key for the per-dataset file listing, and throttles
*far* harder (a bare listing 429s within a couple of calls). So it gets its own
tiny requester with a patient backoff rather than reusing the graph throttle.

Two endpoints matter:

* ``GET /release/latest`` — the newest release id plus a one-line description of
  each dataset. Cheap and unauthenticated.
* ``GET /release/{id}/dataset/{name}`` — the README plus the list of shard
  download URLs. The URLs are **pre-signed S3 links that expire** (hours), so
  they're fetched fresh at download time, never cached to disk — a multi-day
  pull re-requests them as it goes.

Nothing here downloads shard *bytes* (that's ``download.py``); this module only
talks to the JSON index.
