Description:
Resumable downloader for the bulk Datasets shards.

The full corpus is ~300 GB across ~450 gzipped shards (citations ≈ 390 files,
papers ≈ 60), so a download runs for hours-to-days and *will* be interrupted.
This module makes that survivable:

* **Per-shard checkpoint** (``download.json``) records the byte count, the size
  the server advertised, and a done flag for each shard, so a rerun skips
  finished shards and resumes a partial one from where it stopped (HTTP
  ``Range``).
* **Partial shards** land in a ``.part`` file and are only renamed to the final
  ``.gz`` once the body is **provably complete** — a query/ingest never sees a
  truncated shard.
* **Signed-URL expiry** (a mid-download 403/416) triggers a fresh listing from
  :mod:`datasets` and a retry, so a days-long pull rides out expiring links.

**Why completeness is checked explicitly.** CPython's
``http.client.HTTPResponse.read(amt)`` does *not* raise ``IncompleteRead`` when
the connection dies mid-body: it returns ``b""`` and closes the connection, with
a comment in the stdlib saying it would like to raise but won't, for backwards
compatibility. A dropped socket is therefore byte-for-byte indistinguishable
from a clean EOF, so a downloader that trusts "read returned empty" happily
renames a half-shard into place and checkpoints it ``done``. That is exactly
what happened to a 2026-08-05 citations shard, which landed at 577 MB of a
1.07 GB body and only surfaced ~36 minutes into the *ingest*, as a DuckDB
"malformed JSON" error 355 shards deep (see docs/bugs.md). Every completed
transfer is now measured against ``Content-Length`` before the rename, and a
short read leaves the ``.part`` alone so the next attempt resumes the tail.

:func:`verify_release` is the audit for corpora downloaded before that guard
existed — the failure's quiet variant is a truncation landing exactly on a line
boundary, which ingests cleanly and silently drops rows.

Deliberately stdlib-only (``urllib``), matching the rest of the S2 client — no
new HTTP dependency for a job that's just streamed GETs with a ``Range`` header.
Invoked by the ``astronaut corpus download`` / ``astronaut corpus verify`` CLI; not on
any request path.

    """Audit a downloaded release's shards, optionally re-fetching bad ones.

    Written for corpora pulled before the completeness guard in
    :func:`_download_shard` existed, where a dropped connection could leave a
    truncated shard checkpointed as done. The loud failure mode is an ingest
    that dies on malformed JSON; the quiet one is a truncation landing exactly
    on a line boundary, which ingests cleanly and silently drops every row
    after the cut. Only a verification pass finds the second.

    Two checks, cheapest first: every shard's size is compared against what the
    Datasets API says the object actually is, and — with ``deep`` — the gzip
    stream is decompressed end to end, which reads the whole corpus (~400 GB,
    minutes) but needs no network and catches damage a size match can hide.

    Args:
        release_id: The downloaded release to audit.
        datasets_wanted: Which datasets to check — defaults to both.
        deep: Also decompress each shard (slow, thorough).
        repair: Re-download every shard found bad, resuming a usable prefix
            where one exists. Off by default: verification is read-only unless
            asked otherwise.
        on_progress: Optional per-shard callback (see :data:`VerifyProgressFn`).

    Returns:
        One :class:`ShardProblem` per bad shard, empty when the release is
        intact. When ``repair`` is set these are the shards that *were* bad and
        have since been re-fetched.
