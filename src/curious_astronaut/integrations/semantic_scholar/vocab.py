Description:
Semantic Scholar's fields of study — S2's coarse subject vocabulary.

S2's own ~20 top-level fields (Computer Science, Mathematics, …) — what the S2
seed-search filter uses: ``/paper/search`` filters on exactly these
(``fieldsOfStudy``). A fixed, S2-defined vocabulary, small enough to inline as a
tuple (no data file); each value is already its own human-readable label. Title
Case, matching what S2 returns on paper objects and accepts in the filter.

Lives in the ``semantic_scholar`` package because it's S2's vocabulary; arXiv's
parallel (finer) one is ``arxiv.vocab``. See the package README for details.
