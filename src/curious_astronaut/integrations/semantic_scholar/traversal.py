# knowing: v3.1.0 mined landmarks from past the offset ceiling (harvest citers'
# reference lists, co-citation rank, verify), v3.4.0 added the deep pager to fill
# the *latest* window, and v4.0.0 retired the mining when OpenAlex's sorted
# ``cites:`` queries made it redundant. That left the landmark relation riding on
# a pager built for a different purpose — and when v5.0.0 promoted s2 back to a
# first-class provider, nothing replaced the mining. v5.5.0 stops the pager
# short-changing landmarks (it now pages the whole reachable list, not just the
# latest window); reaching *past* the ceiling is the corpus's job, not this

    (offset 0, 1000, 2000, …) until the list runs out or the ``_MAX_OFFSET``
    ceiling is hit, giving up to ~9k citers.

    **It pages the whole list, not just the ``latest`` window** — and that's the
    whole point, because the *landmarks* are what live down there. Until v5.5.0
    this stopped at the first page holding no in-window citer, on the reasoning
    that the window was then behind us and the boundary page's overshoot would
    seed the landmark "middle band". For a hyper-cited seed that reasoning quietly
    gutted the landmark relation: measured live on DQN, page 1 holds exactly ONE
    in-window citer and page 2 holds none, so paging stopped at offset 2000 with a
    pool covering 2024–2026 — while the full reachable list runs back to **2019**
    and holds the citers anyone would call landmarks (Conservative Q-Learning,
    Decision Transformer, Dota 2). Six-sevenths of the reachable pool was never
    fetched, so "Field Landmarks" ranked whatever recent survey happened to be in
    the overshoot.

    Paging on changes ``latest`` not at all — every deeper page is older than the
    window, so they feed only the landmark pool — but it does cost requests the
    window alone wouldn't need, scaling with the citer list up to the ceiling
    (measured on a cache miss, authenticated: QMIX 4 pages / ~8s, DQN 9 pages /
    ~15s). Only a seed whose citers fit in one page is free. That's the trade: a
    slower cold build for a landmark relation that isn't noise. Snapshots cache
    for a day, and the build's progress bar covers the wait.

    **Completeness** is S2's own ``next`` flag, not a page-length heuristic (a
    page can come back short mid-list when S2 fails to resolve some papers): the
    pool is complete when the walk reached a page with no continuation before
    hitting the offset ceiling. Most seeds have well under ~9k citers, so

    """Split a seed's citers into two relations: landmarks and the latest frontier.

    The FALLBACK path (used only when the offline citations corpus can't serve the
    seed). The whole reachable citer list is paged in
    (:func:`_fetch_reachable_pool` — up to ~9k), and **which shape ships depends
    on whether that pool is the seed's complete history**:

    * **Complete** (the list ended before the offset ceiling — the common case;
      most seeds have well under ~9k citers) and a ``landmark_budget`` was
      supplied: the pool is a *whole-history* pool, exactly what the corpus
      holds, so it ships the corpus shape — STOP-prefix landmarks plus
      tau-banded per-year Latest (:func:`_complete_pool_relations`). The
      truncation caveats below simply don't apply.
    * **Truncated** (the ceiling cut the list off): the pool is a recency
      sliver with no all-history ranking to prefix. Citers inside the rolling
      ``_LATEST_WINDOW_MONTHS`` window are the recent **frontier** (``latest``,
      shipped oldest-first so the reveal slider walks toward the present), and
      everything older competes as a historic **landmark** (most-cited first),
      banded by the ``landmark_select`` SKIP rule — a *prefix* of a truncated
      ranking is all one era (DQN's top 29 are 2019–2023, an 18-month hole
      before the frontier), so every year gets its slice instead. What's past
      the ceiling — DQN's 2013–2018 citers, the real giants — no amount of
      paging reaches; that's the corpus's job.

    Args:
        paper_id: An S2 paperId or prefixed id.
        max_landmark_year: The last landmark-era year — the complete-pool split
            boundary (the same one the corpus and OpenAlex split on; passed in so
            the providers stay independent).
        current_year: The last year the complete-pool shape bands, inclusive.
        landmark_select: Optional SKIP rule for the **truncated** pool (see
            :data:`LandmarkSelectFn`); its pick wins over the payload guard.
        landmark_budget: Optional STOP rule for the **complete** pool (see
            :data:`LandmarkBudgetFn`); required for the corpus shape — without
            it a complete pool still ships the truncated shape.
        band_start: Optional Latest band-start chooser for the **complete** pool
            (see :data:`BandStartFn`).
        number_of_bands: The **complete** pool's fixed band span below the
            landmark cutoff, used when ``band_start`` is absent or declines.
            None (the default) reads the shared
            :data:`~curious_astronaut.integrations.caps.LATEST_NUMBER_OF_BANDS` at call
            time; the settings modal's non-adaptive mode passes a number to
            override it per request.
        nodes_per_band: The top-N most-cited citers each one-year band of the
            **complete** pool keeps. None (the default) likewise reads the
            shared :data:`~curious_astronaut.integrations.caps.LATEST_NODES_PER_BAND`.

    Returns:
        ``(landmark_entries, latest_entries)`` — each ``[{"node", "influential"}]``.
