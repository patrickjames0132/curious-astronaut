Description:
Normalizing a raw OpenAlex *work* into the app's graph-node shape — the
OpenAlex twin of ``semantic_scholar/nodes.py``, producing the **same** node dict
so the graph, teacher, and frontend consume one shape regardless of source.

Two OpenAlex-specific translations happen here, both flagged by the spike:

* **Cross-source id.** A citation node must be re-seedable and hydratable
  through the app's existing S2-backed paper routes, so :func:`node` sets the
  node ``id`` to an **S2-resolvable** form — ``DOI:<doi>`` when the work has a
  DOI (nearly every landmark citer does), else ``ARXIV:<id>``, else the bare
  OpenAlex ``W…`` id as a last resort. Clicking such a node hits
  ``/api/paper/<id>`` → ``s2.get_paper`` → S2 resolves the prefix and returns
  the abstract **and TL;DR** OpenAlex itself can't supply (the hybrid's whole
  point). ``arxiv_id`` is filled from the work's arXiv location when present, so
  arXiv links/figures still work.
* **Abstracts** arrive as an inverted index (``{word: [positions]}``), not
  plain text — :func:`reconstruct_abstract` rebuilds the string. Neighbor
  traversals skip it (hydrated lazily on click, like S2's ``NEIGHBOR_FIELDS``).
