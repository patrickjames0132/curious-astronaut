Description:
HTTP transport for OpenAlex: throttling, retries, URL building, and the one
error type this whole package raises.

Rate-limit / pricing strategy (verified against the live API, 2026-07-09):
  * OpenAlex meters usage — a free ``api_key`` grants $1/day, the keyless
    ``mailto`` "polite pool" $0.10/day. **Id/DOI lookups are free**;
    search/filter costs ~$1 per 1,000 calls. A per-seed citation build is a
    handful of filter calls, so the free tier is ample.
  * Both ``mailto`` and ``api_key`` ride as query params (OpenAlex has no auth
    header) — :func:`works_url` / :func:`entity_url` add them centrally.
  * 429 (over budget/rate) and 5xx are retried with exponential backoff; every
    call is paced to at most one per ``openalex.min_interval``, serialized across
    threads (graph build and agent expansion can burst concurrently).

Like the ``semantic_scholar`` client, nothing here uses a third-party HTTP
dependency — stdlib ``urllib`` keeps the client tiny and the deploy simple.
