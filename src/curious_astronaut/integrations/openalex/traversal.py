Description:
Resolving a seed to its OpenAlex work and walking its citers — the OpenAlex
half of the hybrid graph build.

This is the payoff of the 2026-07-09 spike: a seed's citers come from
**server-sorted** ``cites:`` queries, edge guaranteed by the filter. That retires
the entire S2 ``_mined_landmarks`` apparatus (harvest → co-citation rank →
verify), which existed only to work around S2's newest-first, offset-capped
citation endpoint. The citation relation is:

* **landmark** (*Field Landmarks*) — the all-time most-cited citers
  (``cited_by_count:desc``). The historic giants; naturally old.
* **latest** (*Latest Publications*) — recent citers as per-year bands: one
  ``cited_by_count:desc`` query *per year* from the band start up to the current
  year (so no single year dominates — a subtlety we hit live), no separate
  newest-date window. A recent paper that's also an all-time giant stays a
  landmark, not double-shown; the rest ship oldest-first (the reveal slider walks
  toward the present).

The landmark/latest split is by **publication year**, not an exact date, because
OpenAlex dating is coarse (many works are year-only, defaulted to ``01-01``) —
an exact rolling window silently drops recent-year citers. Nodes come out
already S2-resolvable (see ``nodes.py``), so the existing paper routes hydrate
their TL;DRs and re-seed them unchanged.

    Without a ``landmark_budget`` this is one capped fetch — the flat behavior.
    With one, the fetch is a **probe of a single ranked page** (200, the API's
    ``per-page`` maximum), and the rule runs over its years. That works because
    the STOP rule is **prefix-local** — it never reads past the first year to
    overflow — and the server sort puts that prefix at the top of page one, so
    for nearly every seed the exact budget is computable from the one request
    the predicted path was already making (computed budgets across the 58-seed

    ``cite_budget`` model from serving: its reason to exist was that computing
    was assumed to need the *whole* pool (~30k citers for DQN) across the
    network, and it doesn't — it needs the top of the ranking, which is one page.

    The probe is conclusive when the rule stops inside it or the citer list
    itself ends inside it. A seed whose top-200 spread so evenly that no year
    overflows pays for one second, ceiling-sized fetch and re-measures over the
    longer ranking (and a rule answer of None — a declining rule — falls
