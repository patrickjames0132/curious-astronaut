Description:
``integrations.openalex`` — the hybrid citation backbone.

Since v4.0.0 OpenAlex supplies the graph's **citation** relation (landmark +
latest): a server-sorted ``cites:`` query returns a seed's most-cited citers
directly, which retires S2's newest-first reference-list mining. S2 still owns
the seed resolve, references, the *Similar* relation, and TL;DRs — the two are
matched by DOI / arXiv id, and OpenAlex citer nodes are normalized to
S2-resolvable ids so the existing paper routes hydrate and re-seed them.

Public API mirrors ``semantic_scholar``'s shape so a caller reads the same:

    from ..integrations import openalex
    work = openalex.resolve_work(arxiv_id=..., title=..., year=...)
    landmark, latest = openalex.citation_relations(openalex.bare_work_id(work))
