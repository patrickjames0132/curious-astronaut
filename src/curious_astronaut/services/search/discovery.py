Description:
Seed discovery over the local snapshot cache.

``local_search`` scans the graph snapshots already sitting in the SQLite cache
and matches papers by title/authors. It answers instantly and works even when
the provider is rate-limiting us — if you've seen a paper on a graph before,
you can find it again offline.

**Live search used to live here too** (``live_search``: query-analyst expansion,
verified title matches, then a lexical provider search). It was retired in
v7.6.0 along with the ``query_analyst`` agent, because the paper scout does all
three jobs better — it reformulates instead of expanding once, it resolves
recalled titles through ``match_title``, and it can look at what came back and
try again. Two implementations of "search papers" was the same duplication the
v7.0.0 worker split was made to end. This module kept the half the scout
doesn't do: reading the cache, which the scout now calls *into* rather than
duplicating.

    trims them for the search list.

    Matches every whitespace token of ``query`` against a paper's title +

    paper's title doesn't expire. Results are deduped across snapshots (keeping
    whichever record carries more detail) and ranked: whole-phrase title matches
    first, then papers explored directly as seeds, then by citation count.

    **Scoped to ``provider``:** since snapshots are cached per provider
    (``snapshot_prefix``), only the selected backend's snapshots are
    scanned — so a cached paper surfaces here (and the ``has_graph`` "instant"
    badge is truthful) only when it can actually be explored *instantly under

    Four keys, in order:

    1. **Exact title match** — you typed the whole title; nothing outranks it.
    2. **Title starts with the query** — the natural state of a title being

       :func:`local_search` ranks by, generalised across both sources.
    4. **Citation count, descending** — among papers matching equally well,
       the better-known one is the likelier referent of a bare name.
