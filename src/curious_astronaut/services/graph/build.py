Description:
Assemble a paper's neighborhood graph from a single, user-chosen provider.

Given a seed paper, build a Connected-Papers-style graph: the seed plus its
references (papers it cites — its intellectual ancestors) and its citations
(papers that cite it — its descendants, split into all-time landmark citers and
the recent-years frontier). Every relation is drawn from **one** academic-data
provider, chosen per graph:

* **Semantic Scholar** (``provider="s2"``) — seed, references, and citations all
  via S2. Its live citation endpoint is newest-first with no citation sort, so
  landmark citers are recency-biased for a heavily-cited seed (the interim cost,
  lifted later by the offline S2 citations corpus).
* **OpenAlex** (``provider="openalex"``) — seed, references, and citations all
  via OpenAlex, whose server-sorted ``cites:`` / ``cited_by:`` queries return the
  most-cited citers and references directly. The tradeoff is seed resolution: a
  famous published paper resolves to its lower-cited arXiv-preprint record.

This replaced the v4.x **hybrid** (S2 seed/references/similar + OpenAlex
citations, merged with a ``max`` count and cross-source id dedup). A single
provider per graph means one citation-count scale (node sizes are finally
comparable across relations) and no cross-source identity glue. The *Similar*
relation is retired from the graph build entirely (the recommendations client
lives on for the researcher's ``expand_node``). Node identity still dedups
within a provider — a paper reached through two relations, or an OpenAlex
duplicate work, merges into one node via its arXiv id.

Edges are tagged ``reference | citation`` so the frontend can colour and
route them — one tag for every citer since v7.17.0, though the recent-years
pool is still fetched by its own query (see the citation loop below). The whole snapshot is cached (see ``storage/cache.py``), keyed by
**provider *and* seed** so an OpenAlex graph is never served for an S2 selection.

The graph is a typed **Pydantic** ``Graph`` (not a bare dict — the models live
in ``model.py``), so producers and consumers agree on its shape and it validates
on the way in and out of the cache. Callers that need JSON (the routes) serialize
with ``graph.model_dump()`` / ``graph.model_dump_json()``. The cost is a
validate/deserialize on every cache hit — a deliberate trade for a schema that
can't silently drift.

This module is the domain core of the app — ``routes/graph.py``'s ``/api/graph``
is a thin wrapper over ``build_graph`` — so it's commented heavily; the
edge-direction rules in particular are load-bearing (they encode which way a
citation points) and easy to get subtly wrong.
