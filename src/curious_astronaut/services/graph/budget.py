Description:
Serving the adaptive landmark budget — how many landmark citers a seed ships.

Every term used here — landmark, pool, reachable, truncated, label, age origin,
and the two rules below — is defined once, with this same worked example, in
``docs/landmark-vocabulary.md``. The *why* (when to predict, when to compute) is
``docs/predict-vs-compute.md``. This module is the rules as shipped.

The graph build ships up to ``UNBOUNDED_LANDMARK_CAP`` landmark citers per seed
(the shared payload guard — see ``integrations.caps``), but the right
number depends on the seed: an old classic's landmarks span decades and read as a
map of the field, while a young hot paper's top citers pile into one or two years
— same count, far more clutter. Both rules here make "clutter" concrete the same
way: rank a seed's citers most-cited first, drop each into a bucket named by its
publication year, and never let a bucket exceed :data:`PER_YEAR_CAP`.

They differ in **one word** — what happens when a citer lands on a full bucket::

    ranked citer years:  2020  2020  2020  2019  2018  2020  2017    (cap=2)

    STOP  number_of_ranked_citers_before_a_single_year_overflows -> 2
          The third 2020 overflows, so the walk ends there. Ranks 3-6 are
          never reached, though buckets 2019, 2018 and 2017 are empty.

    SKIP  select_up_to_cap_per_year -> [0, 1, 3, 4, 6]
          The third 2020 is skipped and the walk carries on. Five landmarks
          ship, spanning 2017-2020.

Neither rule is a worse version of the other — **which one is honest depends on
the pool**. On a *truncated* pool (the live S2 fallback when the offset ceiling
cuts the list off), SKIP wins: STOP quits at 29 landmarks on truncated DQN with
2020 full and ships **nothing from 2024–2025**, an 18-month hole before the
Latest frontier, where SKIP ships 84 — twelve in each of 2019–2025 — and closes
it. On a *whole-history* pool (the corpus, OpenAlex, a complete live pool),
STOP's count is the honest answer: the prefix of an all-time ranking *is* the
landmark band, tau-banded Latest widens back to meet it, and SKIP-banding there
would admit the best of a thin year over the 13th-best of a blockbuster one.
STOP's scalar output is also what makes it the trained model's regression
**label** — the role it was originally kept for.

Which rule a path *can* use is dictated by what pool it holds, not by taste:

* **Compute a count** (:func:`computed_cite_limit`) — every path holding a
  **whole-history ranking**, which since v5.13.0 is all three:
  the **offline S2 corpus** (the rule runs between the query's two phases, over
  the narrow ranking, before the winners are hydrated wide); **OpenAlex** (the
  STOP rule is *prefix-local* — it never reads past the first year to overflow —
  so a single server-sorted page holds everything it reads: see
  ``openalex._budgeted_landmarks``, and the "Predict" bullet below for what this
  retired); and a **complete live S2 pool** (a seed whose citer list ends before
  the offset ceiling — most seeds — is a whole history too, and ships the corpus
  shape: see ``semantic_scholar.traversal._complete_pool_relations``). One rule,
  three pools, the same count-for-a-ranked-prefix answer.
* **Select from the pool** (:func:`select_landmarks`) — the live S2 fallback's
  **truncated** pools only. The deep pager already holds the whole reachable pool
  before the trim, but when the offset ceiling cut it off, that pool is a recency
  sliver with no all-history ranking to prefix: a prefix strands the recent years,
  so it bands (SKIP) instead.
A third option — **predicting** the count from the seed's age and citation count
with a trained regressor — was retired from serving in v5.13.0 and its code
removed since. It existed for OpenAlex, on the premise that computing there meant
dragging the whole pool across the network (~30k citers for DQN) just to size a
trim. STOP's prefix-locality broke that premise: the number is computable from the
one page the predicted path was already fetching, without the model's ~21-citer
per-seed error.

Why whole-history pools prefix where truncated ones band is the subtlest thing
here — :func:`computed_cite_limit` argues it. Short version: a prefix of a
*whole-history* ranking is exactly what "Field Landmark" means, and Latest widens
back to meet it; a prefix of a *truncated* one is just the recent past twice over.

    **The STOP rule.** Walk the citation-ranked citer years from the top, dropping
    each into a bucket named by its year. The instant a bucket would exceed
    ``cap``, stop the whole walk and return how many were admitted before it. A
    pool that never trips the cap yields its full length::

        years = [2020, 2020, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2020, 2017]

        rank 0  2020  ->  bucket 2020 = 1   admit

        => 2

    Note what it cost: ranks 3-6 are never looked at, though buckets 2019, 2018
    and 2017 are empty. That loss is the rule's defining property, not a bug.

    *What it measures.* ``cap`` is how many same-year papers a landmark view
    tolerates before that year reads as a pile-up. A young, hot paper's top citers
    cram into one or two years, so a bucket floods almost immediately and the
    number is small; an old classic's spread across decades, so nothing floods
    until deep into the list and the number is large. Same top citers, very
    different answer — that gap is the temporal clutter this quantifies.

    Originally this was the retired regressor's training label — kept scalar
    because a regression label has to be. Since the compute paths took over
    (corpus v5.11.0; everywhere v5.13.0) it is the serving rule
    :func:`computed_cite_limit` executes over every whole-history pool. It stops
    rather than skipping full buckets and walking on (as
    :func:`select_up_to_cap_per_year` does) because a prefix is what a
    whole-history ranking honestly ships; on a *truncated* pool the stop is the
    wrong move — see this module's docstring for the 29-vs-84 measurement on DQN.

    An undated citer is admitted without contributing to any bucket — it can't
    crowd a year it isn't in. Training passes an all-dated list (its collector
    drops undated citers before labelling).

        citer_years: Citer publication years in citation rank (most-cited first),
            ``None`` for a citer the provider gave no year.

def computed_cite_limit(citer_years: Sequence[int | None]) -> int:
    """The landmark ship count, **computed** from the pool rather than predicted.

    The one serving rule for every path holding a whole-history ranked pool —
    the **offline S2 corpus**, **OpenAlex** (via the one-page probe), and a
    **complete live S2 pool**. It runs the STOP rule
    (:func:`number_of_ranked_citers_before_a_single_year_overflows`) over the real
    years instead of estimating it from two seed features. The retired regressor's
    training label *is* this number, so this is that model's own answer with the
    estimation error taken out: measured across a 58-seed validation corpus the two
    distributions were near-identical (predicted mean 76.5, computed mean 75.9),
    but the model was ~21 out on any given seed.

    **Why a count here and a selection (:func:`select_landmarks`) on truncated
    live pools** — different pools want different rules:

    * A **truncated** live pool is a recency sliver (the newest ~9k citers) with
      no all-history ranking to prefix, and its Latest window can't reach back
      past it. A prefix there strands the recent years — DQN's top 29 are
      2019–2023 with nothing from 2024–2025, an 18-month hole. So it bands: SKIP.
    * A **whole-history** pool (corpus, OpenAlex, or a live list that ended
      before the ceiling) has Latest as a separate relation that widens back to
      meet the cluster (``bands.earliest_band_year``). A prefix here is exactly
      what "Field Landmark" means — the giants — and banding would instead force
      ``PER_YEAR_CAP`` nodes out of *every* year, admitting the best of a thin
      1970 over the 13th-best of a blockbuster year. It would also flatten the
      year distribution that the tau rule needs to read, breaking the Latest
      bands on these paths.

    — if the rule says 5, 5 is the honest answer.

    The rule for the one pool that can't honestly prefix: the live S2
    fallback's **truncated** pools (a complete live pool takes
    :func:`computed_cite_limit` instead). The walk itself — admit up to
    :data:`PER_YEAR_CAP` per publication year, skipping citers whose year is
    already full — is :func:`select_up_to_cap_per_year`, which has the worked
    example; this wrapper only adds the ceiling and the log line.

    Returns *indices* rather than entries because ``integrations`` owns the citer
    dicts and this layer only ever sees their years; ``build.py`` injects this into
    the live S2 traversal as a callable, keeping ``integrations`` below ``services``
    in the import order — the same shape as ``bands.earliest_band_year`` going into
    the OpenAlex traversal.

    **Undated citers are dropped, not banded.** A Field Landmark is the claim
    "one of the most-cited papers to cite this seed *in year Y*" — a citer with no
    year can't make it, and can't be drawn on a time axis either. Giving them a
    bucket of their own (an earlier cut of this did) ships a guaranteed
    ``PER_YEAR_CAP`` of them, and since they all land on one x, they surface as a
    bare vertical line through the seed's column. They're also the dregs in
    practice: S2 reports no year mostly for PDF-extraction stubs ("This paper is
    included in the Proceedings of…"), not for papers anyone would call landmarks.

    Trimmed to the shared payload guard, which (being a prefix of a
    citation-ranked selection) keeps the most-cited. In practice the guard

    is truncated to a couple of dozen years at most (Hawking's reaches 1998, so
    348). It's defensive, and it keeps every sizing rule agreeing on the same
