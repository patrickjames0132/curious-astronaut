Description:
Neighborhood-graph assembly and its typed models.

* ``build``  — ``build_graph``: the assembly logic (single-provider traversals,
  dedupe, typed edges, cached). ``Provider`` names the backends it can build from.
* ``model``  — the Pydantic ``Graph`` / ``Node`` / ``Edge`` / ``Seed`` /
  ``Counts`` the graph is made of.

Both are re-exported here, so callers use ``graph.build_graph(...)`` /
``graph.Graph`` without reaching into the submodules.
