Description:
Readable body text straight out of a PDF file.

The pymupdf twin of the ar5iv reader (``integrations/arxiv/fulltext.py``) for
papers that only exist as PDFs. Quality is honest-but-lower: a PDF has no
semantic markup, so headers/footers ride along and equations come out as
whatever Unicode the font encoded — good enough to ground an answer in a
paper's methods and numbers, which is the researcher's use case.
