Description:
Caption-anchored float mining: a PDF's figures, tables, and algorithms.

A paper PDF carries no semantic markup — just text, embedded images, and
vector drawings — so "the paper's figures" have to be reconstructed from
layout. Mining is **caption-first**: find the caption blocks (``Figure N:``,
``Table N:``, ``Algorithm N``), then locate each float's content region
relative to its caption, which both finds the right pixels and rejects junk
(a drawing cluster with no caption is a decoration, not a figure):

* **Figure** — captions sit BELOW their content (fallback: above). The region
  seeds from every image rect / vector-drawing cluster adjacent to the
  caption, then grows by axis-aware chaining (``_chain_near``) so side-by-side
  subfigures, film-strip tiles, and the scattered pieces of sparse line
  drawings all join in. Size is judged at the answer: candidate clusters may
  be tiny (``_MIN_CLUSTER_AREA`` only drops dust), but the grown region must
  clear ``_MIN_REGION_AREA``. The package README's "The geometry, precisely"
  section walks the whole pipeline with its terminology.
* **Table** — captions sit ABOVE (fallback: below). Tries pymupdf's
  ``find_tables`` bbox first, then a span of same-width horizontal rules
  (booktabs tables are rules-only and invisible to ``find_tables``), then a
  drawing-skeleton cluster widened to the caption's x-span (tables whose only
  ink is a header rule plus column tick marks).
* **Algorithm** — the caption sits just under the float's TOP rule; the
  region runs to the last same-width rule. The rule anchor doubles as the
  prose filter ("Algorithm 1 shows…" body text has no rule above it).

The caption regex requires ``:``/``.`` after a Figure/Table number precisely
because in-prose references ("Figure 2 provides…") start identically.

Floats made purely of text (no images, drawings, or rules — e.g. a
pseudo-code figure in a very old PDF) are the known miss: nothing anchors
them geometrically, so they're skipped rather than guessed at.

Beware one pymupdf trap (cost this module a debugging session in the spike):
a hairline rule is an EMPTY rect (zero height), and ``Rect.__or__`` silently
ignores empty operands — rule spans are therefore built from raw
coordinates, never with ``|``.
