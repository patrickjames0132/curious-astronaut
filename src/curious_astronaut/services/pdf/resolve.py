Description:
Where a paper's open-access PDF lives — resolved once, cached, shared.

Three tiers, cheapest first:

* An **arXiv id** needs no lookup at all: ``arxiv.org/pdf/<id>`` is always
  open access (used when ar5iv has no render to mine instead).
* A **known URL** (a node hydrated with ``oa_pdf`` in hand) is cached for
  later callers via ``prime`` — the detail route primes on hydration so the
  figures route that fires moments later doesn't re-ask the provider.
* Otherwise the **provider** is asked (S2's ``openAccessPdf`` / OpenAlex's
  location ``pdf_url``, both surfaced as the node dict's ``oa_pdf``), and the
  answer — including "this paper has no OA PDF" — is cached for a month so
  repeat reads and panel opens cost nothing.
