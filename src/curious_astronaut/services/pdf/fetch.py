Description:
Download an open-access PDF into the on-disk cache, once.

PDFs are orders of magnitude bigger than the JSON this app otherwise moves,
so they get their own cache: real files under ``data_dir/pdf_cache`` (not rows
in the SQLite cache), named by a hash of their URL, pruned LRU beyond
``config.pdf.cache_files``. Everything downstream — text extraction, float
mining, on-demand figure rendering — works from the cached file, so a paper's
PDF is fetched at most once per prune cycle.

Downloads are defensive by design: the size cap aborts mid-stream (a
Content-Length header can lie or be absent), and the ``%PDF`` magic check
rejects the HTML login/consent pages some publishers serve where a PDF was
promised.
