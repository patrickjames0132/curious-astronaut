Description:
Figures out of the user's own uploaded PDFs — the library twin of
``services/pdf``'s open-access mining.

Since v5.28.0 an uploaded PDF's original file is kept beside its indexed text
(``store.pdf_path``), so the same caption-anchored extractor that mines
journal papers (``services.pdf.floats``) can mine the user's own material:
one **figure manifest** per source (kind, page, caption, region — cached in
SQLite; no pixels stored), with images rendered on demand by the
``/api/sources/<id>/figure/<n>`` route.

What differs from the OA pipeline is only addressing: no URL, no download —
the file is local and owned by us, keyed by source id. URL sources and
sources ingested before the file was kept have no PDF on disk and degrade to
"no figures", never an error.
