Description:
Local text embeddings for semantic search, via sentence-transformers.

The model is loaded lazily and cached process-wide the first time an embedding is
actually needed, so importing this module never pays the (large) torch import +
model-load cost. Everything degrades gracefully: if sentence-transformers isn't
installed or the model can't load, ``available()`` returns False and callers
report that instead of crashing.

Embeddings are L2-normalized, so a dot product equals cosine similarity — the
distance metric configured on the sqlite-vec table (see ``store``).

The model runs on whatever ``config.sources.embedding.device`` selects — by
default "auto", i.e. sentence-transformers' own detection, which lands on the
GPU when torch has a CUDA build. Ingest is where that matters: it embeds
thousands of chunks in batches, while a single query embedding is dominated by
overhead either way.
