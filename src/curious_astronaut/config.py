Description:
Central configuration for Curious Astronaut, loaded from config.json.

Every tunable — paths, API keys, model names, agent definitions — lives in
one JSON file at the repo root, parsed by Pydantic into the nested
``config`` object below. There are **no defaults**: config.json must spell
out every value (copy ``config.example.json`` to start), and any mistake —
an unknown key, a negative limit, a misspelled literal — fails loudly at
import time instead of silently becoming a default. Each field carries its
own ``description`` explaining what it does and why its example value is
what it is; for cross-cutting rationale (why a config choice affects several
fields at once) see docs/configuration.md.

    from curious_astronaut.config import config
    config.llm.providers.anthropic.api_key
    config.llm.agents[0].model  # "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6"

The models are mutable on purpose: the test suite's autouse ``_isolate``
fixture points ``config.storage.data_dir`` at a per-test temp directory
and zeroes ``config.providers.s2.min_interval`` so tests never touch real data or
sleep. Keep field lookups late (``config.x.y`` at call time, not a
module-level ``from ... import y``) so those overrides are seen.
