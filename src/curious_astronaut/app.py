Description:
Flask app factory for Curious Astronaut.

The API surface lives in ``routes/`` — one blueprint per concern (graph,
search, agents, sources, sessions). This module just builds the app, wires
those blueprints on, and (in production) serves the built React frontend.

See ``routes/README.md`` for the endpoint list.

# Installed from a wheel it is bundled *inside* the package as `_frontend/`

# `npm run build` and gitignored. Prefer the bundled copy when present so an
# installed copy never depends on a checkout being nearby, and fall back to the
# checkout so `npm run build` keeps taking effect during development without a
# reinstall. Module-level so tests can point it elsewhere.
